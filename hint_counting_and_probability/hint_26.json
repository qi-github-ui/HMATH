    "problem": "Two cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that both cards are numbers (2 through 10) totaling to 12?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are two cases that we have to consider.\n\n$\\bullet~$ Case 1: The first card is one of 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n\nThere are 32 such cards, so this occurs with probability $\\dfrac{32}{52}$.  For any of these cards, there are 4 cards left in the deck such that the cards sum to 12, so the probability of drawing one is $\\dfrac{4}{51}$.  Thus, the probability that this case occurs is $\\dfrac{32}{52}\\times\\dfrac{4}{51} = \\dfrac{32}{663}$.\n\n$\\bullet~$ Case 2: The first card is a 6.\n\nThere are 4 of these, so this occurs with probability $\\dfrac{4}{52}$.  Now we need to draw another 6.  There are only 3 left in the deck, so the probability of drawing one is $\\dfrac{3}{51}$.  Thus, the probability that this case occurs is $\\dfrac{4}{52}\\times\\dfrac{3}{51} = \\dfrac{3}{663}$.\n\nTherefore the overall probability is $\\dfrac{32}{663} + \\dfrac{3}{663} = \\boxed{\\frac{35}{663}}. $",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the problem is asking for in your own words?\n2. What are the two cases that we need to consider? Why do we need to consider them separately?\n3. For case 1, why do we have 32 cards that could be chosen for the first card? How many cards are left in the deck after choosing the first card?\n4. How many cards in the remaining deck would result in a sum of 12 when paired with one of the cards from case 1? Why do we divide by 51 to find the probability of drawing one of these cards?\n5. Following the same reasoning, why do we have 4 cards for case 1 and 3 cards for case 2 that lead to a sum of 12? How do we calculate the probability for case 2?\n6. How can we find the overall probability of both cards totaling to 12? What operations do we need to perform with the probabilities of case 1 and case 2?\n7. Can you simplify the expression for the overall probability? What is the final result?"
