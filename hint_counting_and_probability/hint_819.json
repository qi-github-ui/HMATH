    "solution": "If all four of the dots are collinear, it is obvious that it must either be a horizontal line of dots, a vertical line of dots, or a diagonal line of dots. And inspection tells us that there are $4 + 4 + 2 = 10$ such collinear sets of 4. And in total, there are ${16 \\choose 4} = \\frac{16\\cdot 15 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 13}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 14 = 1820$. So, the probability is $\\frac{10}{1820} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{182}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for the four dots to be collinear? How would you describe this concept in your own words?\n2. How many possible sets of four dots can be chosen from the given square array? Can you explain your reasoning?\n3. Can you identify the different types of collinear sets of four dots that can be formed? How many sets are there for each type?\n4. How could you calculate the total number of possible sets of four dots? Can you explain the formula you would use and why it works?\n5. What is the probability of randomly choosing a collinear set of four dots? Can you show step-by-step how you would calculate this probability using the information given?\n6. Can you think of any other geometric scenarios where the concept of collinear sets could be applied? How might the probability calculations differ in those situations?"
