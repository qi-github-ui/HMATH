    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "\\begin{align*}\n\\dbinom{n}{n-1}&=\\dfrac{n!}{(n-1)!~1!}\\\\\n&=\\dfrac{n\\times(n-1)\\times(n-2)\\times(n-3)\\times\\cdots\\times 2\\times 1}{(n-1)\\times (n-2)\\times (n-3)\\times \\cdots \\times 2\\times 1}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{n}.\n\\end{align*}Also, $\\binom{n}{n-1}$ is the number of ways to choose $n-1$ objects out of $n$.  This is equivalent to choosing $1$ object not to use.  Since there are $n$ different objects, there are $\\boxed{n}$ ways to do this.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the notation $\\binom{n}{n-1}$ and what it represents?\n2. How would you expand the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{n-1}$ using factorials? \n3. What does it mean to cancel out terms when simplifying fractions?\n4. Can you describe the pattern that emerges when simplifying $\\binom{n}{n-1}$?\n5. How does the number of ways to choose $n-1$ objects out of $n$ relate to $\\binom{n}{n-1}$?\n6. Can you think of a real-life situation where calculating $\\binom{n}{n-1}$ would be useful?"
