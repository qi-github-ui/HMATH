    "problem": "An unfair coin lands on heads with probability $\\frac34$ and tails with probability $\\frac14$.  A heads flip gains $\\$3$, but a tails flip loses $\\$8$.  What is the expected worth of a coin flip? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "By definition, we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities, and add them up: $E = \\frac34(+\\$3) + \\frac14(-\\$8) = \\boxed{\\$0.25}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of \"expected worth\" in the context of probability?\n2. How do we calculate the expected worth of an event? Can you explain step-by-step?\n3. What are the possible outcomes of flipping the coin in this scenario?\n4. What are the probabilities associated with each outcome?\n5. How do we assign a value to each outcome in order to calculate the expected worth?\n6. Can you calculate the expected worth based on the given probabilities and values?\n7. Can you explain why we multiply the outcomes by their respective probabilities?\n8. How do we interpret the final expected worth value in this context?\n9. Can you explain why the expected worth in this case is positive or negative?\n10. Can you think of any real-life scenarios where understanding expected worth would be useful?"
