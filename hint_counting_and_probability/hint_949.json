    "problem": "In the local frisbee league, teams have 7 members and each of the 4 teams takes turns hosting tournaments. At each tournament, each team selects two members of that team to be on the tournament committee, except the host team, which selects three members. How many possible 9 member tournament committees are there?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Pick one of the teams as the host. There are $\\dbinom{7}{3}=35$ ways to select the three representatives from that team and $\\dbinom{7}{2}=21$ ways to pick a representative from each of the other teams. So once we have selected a host team, there are $35\\times21\\times21\\times21=324,\\!135$ ways to pick the members of the tournament committee. However, any of the four teams can be the host, so we need to multiply $324,\\!135$ by 4 to get $\\boxed{1,\\!296,\\!540}$ ways.",

How many members are on a tournament committee?\n5. How are the members of the tournament committee selected?\n6. How many members are selected from the host team?\n7. How many members are selected from each of the other teams?\n8. How many possible ways are there to select the members of the tournament committee for one tournament hosted by a particular team?\n9. How do you calculate the total number of possible tournament committees?\n10. Why do we need to multiply the number of possible tournament committees by 4?\n11. What is the final answer to the problem?"
