    "problem": "How many three-digit numbers are composed of three distinct digits such that one digit is the average of the other two?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The set of the three digits of such a number can be arranged to form an increasing arithmetic sequence.  There are 8 possible sequences with a common difference of 1, since the first term can be any of the digits 0 through 7.  There are 6 possible sequences with a common difference of 2, 4 with a common difference of 3, and 2 with a common difference of 4. Hence there are 20 possible arithmetic sequences. Each of the 4 sets that contain 0 can be arranged to form $2\\cdot2!=4$ different numbers, and the 16 sets that do not contain 0 can be arranged to form $3!=6$ different numbers.  Thus there are a total of $4\\cdot4+16\\cdot6=\\boxed{112}$ numbers with the required properties.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the problem is asking for in your own words?\n2. How would you define a three-digit number composed of three distinct digits?\n3. Can you describe what it means for one digit to be the average of the other two in this context?\n4. How would you identify if a set of three digits can form an increasing arithmetic sequence?\n5. Can you explain why there are 8 possible sequences with a common difference of 1?\n6. How did you determine that there are 6 possible sequences with a common difference of 2, 4 with a common difference of 3, and 2 with a common difference of 4?\n7. Why did you add up the numbers of sequences for each common difference to find the total number of possible arithmetic sequences?\n8. How did you determine the number of different numbers that can be formed for sets containing 0 and those that do not contain 0?\n9. Can you explain why there are $4\\cdot4+16\\cdot6=\\boxed{112}$ numbers with the required properties?\n10. Can you think of any similar problems that might require a similar approach of analyzing arithmetic sequences and distinct digits?"
