    "problem": "We call a number a mountain number if its middle digit is larger than any other digit.  For example, 284 is a mountain number.  How many 3-digit mountain numbers are there?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We will break this into three cases.\n\nCase 1: numbers of the form $xyx$ ($x \\ne 0$).\n\nAny pair of nonzero digits has a corresponding palindrome ($xyx$) mountain number, so the number of these is $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$.\n\nCase 2: numbers of the form $xyz$ ($z \\ne 0, x \\ne z$).\n\nAny group of three nonzero digits ($y > x > z > 0$) has two corresponding mountain numbers ($xyz$ and $zyx$), so the number of these is $2 \\times \\binom{9}{3} = 168$.\n\nCase 3: numbers of the form $xy0$ ($x \\ne 0, y \\ne 0$).\n\nAny pair of nonzero digits has a corresponding mountain number in the form $xy0$, so there are $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ of these.\n\nSo the total number of mountain numbers is $36 + 168 + 36 = \\boxed{240}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is a mountain number? Can you provide an example?\n2. How many digits are in a mountain number? \n3. What is the middle digit of a 3-digit mountain number?\n4. Can the middle digit be the same as any other digit in a mountain number?\n5. How many possible choices are there for the middle digit in a 3-digit mountain number?\n6. In Case 1, why do any pair of nonzero digits have a corresponding palindrome mountain number in the form $xyx$? \n7. In Case 2, why are there two corresponding mountain numbers for any group of three nonzero digits? \n8. Why can't $z$ be equal to $x$ in Case 2? \n9. How many possible choices are there for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in Case 2? \n10. In Case 3, why do any pair of nonzero digits have a corresponding mountain number in the form $xy0$?\n11. How many possible choices are there for $x$ and $y$ in Case 3?\n12. What is the total number of 3-digit mountain numbers? \n13. How did we arrive at the final answer of 240? \n14. Can you think of other types of numbers that might have certain criteria for their digits?"
