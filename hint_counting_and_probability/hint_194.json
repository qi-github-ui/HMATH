    "problem": "In how many ways can 6 distinct beads be placed on a bracelet? (Note that two arrangements are the same if one can be rotated or reflected to produce the other.)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $6!$ ways to place the beads on the bracelet, but we must divide by 6 for rotational symmetry (6 rotations for each arrangement), and by 2 for reflectional symmetry (we can flip the bracelet to get the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{6!}{6 \\times 2} = \\boxed{60}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many distinct beads are there?\n2. What is the total number of arrangements possible for the 6 beads?\n3. Why do we need to divide by 6 for rotational symmetry? \n4. How does reflectional symmetry affect the total number of arrangements?\n5. What is the formula that takes rotational and reflectional symmetry into account?\n6. How do we arrive at the final answer of 60 arrangements?"
