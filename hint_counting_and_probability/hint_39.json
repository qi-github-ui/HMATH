    "problem": "The Boston weatherman says there is a 75 percent chance of rain for each day of the Labor Day four-day weekend. If it doesn't rain, then the weather will be sunny.  Paul and Yuri want it to be sunny one of those days for a World War III preenactment, but if it's sunny for more than one day they won't know what to do with themselves. What is the probability they get the weather they want? Give your answer as a fraction.",

    "solution": "There are $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways to choose which three of the four days it will be rainy so that the other day it will be sunny. For any of those 4 choices, there is a $\\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right) ^3 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right) ^1 = \\frac{27}{256}$ chance for that choice to happen, because there is a $\\frac{3}{4}$ chance that we get what we want when we want it to be rainy, and a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that we get what we want when we want it to be sunny. The total probability is then $4 \\cdot \\frac{27}{256}= \\boxed{\\frac{27}{64}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the problem is asking for in your own words?\n2. What does it mean for there to be a 75 percent chance of rain for each day of the Labor Day four-day weekend?\n3. How can we determine the probability of getting the weather Paul and Yuri want?\n4. What are the different possibilities for the weather during the four-day weekend?\n5. How many ways can we choose three out of the four days for rain and the remaining day for sun?\n6. For each of the four possible choices, what is the probability of getting the desired weather?\n7. Can you explain why the probability for each choice is $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$?\n8. By multiplying the probability of each choice by the number of choices, can you calculate the total probability?\n9. What is the final probability of getting the weather Paul and Yuri want? Express it as a fraction.\n10. Can you think of any similar scenarios or problems where probability calculations can be applied in a similar way?"
