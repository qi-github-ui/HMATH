    "problem": "How many three-digit whole numbers have no 7's and no 9's as digits?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "In order to be a three-digit number, the first digit cannot be 0, so there are normally 9 choices for the hundreds digit. But it also cannot be 7 or 9, so there are actually only 7 choices for the hundreds digit, and then 8 digits each for the units and tens digits. So, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{448}$ such numbers.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the specific requirement for a number to be included in the count of three-digit whole numbers with no 7's and no 9's as digits?\n2. How many choices are there for the hundreds digit of a three-digit number? Why is this number reduced to 7 in this case?\n3. How many choices are there for the units and the tens digit of a three-digit number in this case? Why is it 8 for both digits?\n4. How do you calculate the total number of three-digit whole numbers with no 7's and no 9's as digits by multiplying the choices for each digit? \n5. Are there any other similar cases where you need to count the number of whole numbers with certain conditions? Can you provide some examples?\n6. How can you verify that the final answer, 448, is correct? Is there any other way to approach this problem?"
