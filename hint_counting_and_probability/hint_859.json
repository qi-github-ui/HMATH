    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what a license plate for this state consists of? \n2. How many letters are on a license plate for this state? \n3. How many digits are on a license plate for this state? \n4. What is the condition for a letter to be repeated on a license plate? \n5. How many ways are there to choose the repeated letter from the alphabet? \n6. How many ways are there to choose the other two letters on the license plate? \n7. In how many ways can the repeated letters be arranged on the license plate? \n8. In how many ways can the remaining two letters be arranged on the license plate? \n9. How many ways are there to choose the first digit on the license plate? \n10. How many ways are there to choose the second digit on the license plate? \n11. Can you explain why we multiply all of these values together to find the total number of possible license plate combinations? \n12. Can you think of any variations to this problem that could change the number of possible license plates?"
