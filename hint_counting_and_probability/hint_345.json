    "problem": "If two distinct numbers are selected at random from the first seven prime numbers, what is the probability that their sum is an even number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The only way for the sum to not be even is if one of the primes chosen is 2. There are six pairs where one of the primes is 2, and there are $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ total possible pairs, so the probability that the sum is NOT even is $\\frac{6}{21}=\\frac{2}{7}$. Therefore, the probability that the sum IS even is $1-\\frac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean for two numbers to be selected at random from a set?\n2. How many prime numbers are there in the first seven prime numbers set?\n3. How many possible pairs of distinct numbers can be formed from seven prime numbers?\n4. How can we determine if the sum of two numbers is even or odd?\n5. In this case, what is the condition for the sum to be odd?\n6. Why is it the only way for the sum to be odd if one of the primes chosen is 2?\n7. How many pairs can be formed where 2 is one of the primes?\n8. How can we calculate the probability of choosing a pair where the sum is not even?\n9. What is the total number of possible pairs that can be selected?\n10. How can we determine the probability that the sum is even?\n11. What is the relationship between the probability of the sum being even and the probability of the sum being not even?\n12. What is the final answer to the question: the probability that the sum is an even number?"
