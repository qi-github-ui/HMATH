    "problem": "How many three digit numbers are left if we exclude all three digit numbers in which there are exactly two digits the same, but these two digits are not adjacent?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The only three digit numbers which are ruled out are numbers of the form $ABA$, where A and B are different digits. There are 9 ways to choose A, since it can't be 0, and once A has been chosen there are 9 ways to choose B. Since there are $9\\cdot10\\cdot10=900$ total three digit numbers, and $9\\cdot9=81$ numbers which aren't valid, there are $900-81=\\boxed{819}$ valid numbers.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for two digits to be \"adjacent\" in a three-digit number?\n2. How would you determine if a three-digit number has exactly two digits the same but not adjacent?\n3. Can you list some examples of three-digit numbers where exactly two digits are the same but not adjacent?\n4. Can you think of any patterns or relationships among these examples?\n5. Why are numbers of the form $ABA$ ruled out? What makes them invalid?\n6. How many choices are there for the first digit A? And for the second digit B? Why?\n7. What is the total number of three-digit numbers? Can you explain how you arrived at this number?\n8. How many of these three-digit numbers are not valid based on the given conditions?\n9. How can we find the count of valid numbers using the numbers of total numbers and invalid numbers?\n10. What is the final count of three-digit numbers that satisfy the given conditions?"
