    "problem": "In how many ways can 81 be written as the sum of three positive perfect squares if the order of the three perfect squares does not matter?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since we are partitioning 81 into sums of perfect squares, we proceed by subtracting out perfect squares and seeing which work: $81 - 64 = 17 = 16 + 1$. Further, $81 - 49 = 32 = 16+ 16$. And finally, $81 - 36 = 45 = 36 + 9$. Although there is more to check through, this sort of method should convince us that these are the only $\\boxed{3}$ solutions: $1^2 + 4^2 + 8^2 = 81$, $4^2 + 4^2 + 7^2 = 81$, and $3^2 + 6^2 + 6^2 = 81$.",

If we choose to subtract out perfect squares, how do we determine which perfect squares to subtract? \n4. How do we know that these are the only possible solutions? \n5. Can you explain why the order of the three perfect squares does not matter in this problem? \n6. Can you think of any other problem that involves partitioning a number into sums of perfect squares using similar thinking and steps?"
