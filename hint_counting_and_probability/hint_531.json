    "problem": "At the end of the year, the Math Club decided to hold an election for which 5 equal officer positions were available. However, 16 candidates were nominated, of whom 7 were past officers. Of all possible elections of the officers, how many will have at least 1 of the past officers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The number of total ways to choose the 5 officers is $\\binom{16}{5} = 4368$.  Of these, the number of ways to choose the officers without ANY of the past officers is $\\binom{9}{5} = 126$. Thus, the number of ways to choose the 5 officers with at least 1 past officer is $4368 - 126 = \\boxed{4242}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many positions are available for the Math Club election?\n2. How many candidates were nominated in total?\n3. How many of the nominated candidates were past officers?\n4. How many candidates are not past officers?\n5. How many ways are there to choose 5 officers from the 16 candidates?\n6. How many ways are there to choose 5 officers without any past officers?\n7. How many ways are there to choose 5 officers with at least 1 past officer?\n8. How did you calculate the number of ways to choose the officers without any past officers?\n9. Can you explain the calculation for the number of ways to choose the officers with at least 1 past officer?\n10. Are there any other possible ways to calculate the number of ways to choose the officers without any past officers?\n11. What would happen if the number of available officer positions was different?\n12. Can you think of any real-life scenarios where understanding counting and probability would be useful?"
