    "problem": "In the United States, coins have the following thicknesses: penny, 1.55 mm; nickel, 1.95 mm; dime, 1.35 mm; quarter, 1.75 mm. If a stack of these coins is exactly 14 mm high, how many coins are in the stack?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The height in millimeters of any stack with an odd number of coins has a 5 in the hundredth place.  The height of any two coins has an odd digit in the tenth place and a zero in the hundredth place.  Therefore any stack with zeros in both its tenth and hundredth places must consist of a number of coins that is a multiple of 4. The highest stack of 4 coins has a height of $4(1.95)= 7.8 \\; \\text{mm}$, and the shortest stack of 12 coins has a height of $12(1.35)= 16.2 \\; \\text{mm}$, so no number other than $\\boxed{8}$ can work. Note that a stack of 8 quarters has a height of $8(1.75)= 14\\; \\text{mm}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information in the problem?\n2. Can you restate the problem in your own words?\n3. What is the significance of the thickness measurements given for each coin?\n4. How can we use the given thicknesses to determine the height of a stack of coins?\n5. Why is it mentioned that the height of any stack with an odd number of coins has a 5 in the hundredth place?\n6. Why is it mentioned that the height of any two coins has an odd digit in the tenth place and a zero in the hundredth place?\n7. What information does the statement about the zeros in the tenth and hundredth places provide about the number of coins in a stack?\n8. Why does the height of a stack with zeros in both the tenth and hundredth places have to be a multiple of 4?\n9. Based on the information provided, what is the minimum and maximum number of coins that could be in the stack?\n10. Can you explain why no number other than 8 can work for the height of the stack?\n11. How does a stack of 8 quarters meet the given conditions?\n12. Can you think of any other types of stacks that would satisfy the given conditions?\n13. Can you generalize the approach used in this problem to solve similar problems involving stacks of coins?"
