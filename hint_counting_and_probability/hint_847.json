    "problem": "Four people sit around a circular table, and each person will roll a standard six-sided die. What is the probability that no two people sitting next to each other will roll the same number after they each roll the die once? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "Consider the people around the table, sequentially, to be A, B, C and D. Now, with probability $\\frac{1}{6}$, persons A and C, seated opposite one another, will roll the same number. In that case, each of B and D may roll any of 5 numbers not equal to the number rolled by both A and C. So the probability of no two consecutive persons rolling the same number in the case where A and C roll the same is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}$. A and C roll differently with probability $\\frac{5}{6}$, in which case each of B and D must choose from only 4 numbers, because A and C offer different numbers to be avoided. So, the probability then is $\\frac{5}{6} \\cdot \\frac{4}{6} \\cdot \\frac{4}{6}$. Adding the two cases gives $\\frac{5(5 + 4 \\cdot 4)}{6^3} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 36} = \\boxed{\\frac{35}{72}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the problem in your own words? What are we trying to find?\n2. How many people are sitting around the table? Does the seating arrangement matter?\n3. How many sides are there on the standard six-sided die? How many possible outcomes are there for each person?\n4. What does it mean for two people to roll the same number?\n5. Let's consider the case where persons A and C, seated opposite each other, roll the same number. What is the probability of this happening?\n6. If A and C roll the same number, what are the possible outcomes for persons B and D? How many choices do they have?\n7. Now, let's consider the case where A and C roll different numbers. What is the probability of this happening?\n8. If A and C roll different numbers, what are the possible outcomes for persons B and D? How many choices do they have?\n9. Can you calculate the probability of no two consecutive persons rolling the same number using the information we discussed?\n10. Can you calculate the final probability by combining the cases where A and C roll the same number and when they roll different numbers?"
