    "problem": "Consider a regular octagon.  How many triangles can be formed whose vertices are the vertices of the octagon?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle. There are 8 ways to choose the first point, 7 ways to choose the second point, and 6 ways to choose the third point, but we must divide by $3!$ since order doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3!} = \\boxed{56}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many vertices does a regular octagon have?\n2. When forming a triangle, how many vertices are needed?\n3. Are there any restrictions on the vertices that can be chosen to form a triangle?\n4. How many ways can we choose the first vertex for the triangle?\n5. How many ways can we choose the second vertex for the triangle after choosing the first vertex? Why?\n6. How many ways can we choose the third vertex for the triangle after choosing the first two vertices? Why?\n7. Why do we need to divide by $3!$ in the final calculation?\n8. What is the reason for dividing by $3!$ if order doesn't matter?\n9. What is the final solution for the number of triangles that can be formed?\n10. Are there any other ways to approach this problem and still arrive at the same answer?"
