    "problem": "A pirate is searching for buried treasure on 6 islands. On each island, there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that the island has buried treasure and no traps, a $\\frac{1}{12}$ chance that the island has traps but no treasure, and a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance that the island has neither traps nor treasure. What is the probability that while searching all 6 islands, the pirate will encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure, and none with traps?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose 3 islands. For each of these choices, there is a probability of $\\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3$ that the chosen islands have treasure and the remaining ones have neither treasure nor traps. Therefore, the probability that the pirate encounters exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps is $20 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{54}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem we are trying to solve?\n2. What are the chances of finding treasure or traps on each island?\n3. How many islands does the pirate need to search to encounter exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps?\n4. What is the total number of possible ways to choose 3 islands from 6?\n5. What is the probability of choosing 3 islands that have treasure and the remaining ones have neither treasure nor traps?\n6. How do we calculate the overall probability of the pirate encountering exactly 3 islands with treasure and none with traps?\n7. How do the given probabilities affect the final result? Is there any other information we need to consider?\n8. Can we use a similar approach to calculate the probability of the pirate encountering different numbers of islands with treasure or traps?"
