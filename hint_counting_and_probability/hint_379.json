    "problem": "How many 4-letter words with at least one consonant can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$?  (Note that $B$, $C$, and $D$ are consonants, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, or $E$, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no consonant must be one of $A$ or $E$. So the number of all 4-letter words with no consonants is $2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2=16$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625-16=\\boxed{609}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the problem in your own words? What are we trying to count in this problem?\n2. What is the total number of 4-letter words that can be formed using the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ without any restrictions?\n3. How can we count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants? \n4. What are the possible letters for a word with no consonants? How many choices do we have for each letter?\n5. How can we calculate the total number of 4-letter words with no consonants using the choices we identified in the previous question?\n6. How can we calculate the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant using the information we have so far?\n7. Can you summarize the steps we have taken so far to arrive at our final answer?\n8. Are there any other interpretations or approaches to solving this problem that we can explore?\n9. Can you apply the same reasoning and steps to solve similar problems involving different letters or word lengths?"
