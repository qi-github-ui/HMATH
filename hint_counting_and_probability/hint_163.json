    "solution": "We first factor 180 into three positive integers from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Since $180 > 5^3 = 125,$ at least one of the integers must be 6. Since $180 > 5^2\\cdot 6 = 150$, at least two integers must equal 6. Indeed, $180 = 5\\cdot6\\cdot6$ is the only such way to factor 180. Therefore, $(a,b,c) = (5,6,6), (6,5,6),(6,6,5)$ are the only possibilities for $a,b,c$. Each occurs with probability $\\left(\\frac16\\right)^3 = \\frac1{216}$, so the probability that $abc = 180$ is $3\\cdot \\frac1{216} = \\boxed{\\frac1{72}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the problem in your own words? What are we trying to find the probability of?\n2. What does it mean for the product of three numbers to be 180? How can we break down 180 into three factors?\n3. Why do we know that at least one of the numbers must be 6 in order for the product to be 180?\n4. Can you explain why at least two of the numbers must be 6? Is there a mathematical reason behind this?\n5. How did we determine that the factorization $180 = 5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6$ is the only possibility?\n6. What is the probability of getting each of the three possible combinations of numbers: $(5, 6, 6)$, $(6, 5, 6)$, and $(6, 6, 5)$? How did you calculate this?\n7. Can you multiply the probabilities of each combination with 180 to find the probability that $abc = 180$?\n8. Is there any other way to approach this problem using a different method or strategy? How might you go about solving a similar problem?"
