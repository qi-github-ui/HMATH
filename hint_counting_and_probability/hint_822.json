    "problem": "How many non-congruent triangles with perimeter 7 have integer side lengths?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The longest side cannot be greater than 3, since otherwise the remaining two sides would not be long enough to form a triangle. The only possible triangles have side lengths $1$--$3$--$3$ or $2$--$2$--$3$. Hence the answer is $\\boxed{2}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of a non-congruent triangle?\n2. How do we determine if a set of three integers is able to form a triangle?\n3. Given the perimeter of the triangle is 7, what are the possible sets of side lengths?\n4. How did we come to the conclusion that the longest side cannot be greater than 3?\n5. Why are the only possible triangles with integer side lengths $1$--$3$--$3$ or $2$--$2$--$3$?\n6. Can we use a similar approach to find the number of non-congruent triangles with integer side lengths for a different perimeter value? \n7. How would the answer change if we allowed for congruent triangles?"
