    "problem": "A traffic light runs repeatedly through the following cycle: green for 30 seconds, then yellow for 3 seconds, and then red for 30 seconds.  Leah picks a random three-second time interval to watch the light.  What is the probability that the color changes while she is watching?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The light completes a cycle every 63 seconds.  Leah sees the color change if and only if she begins to look within three seconds before the change from green to yellow, from yellow to red, or from red to green.  Thus she sees the color change with probability $(3+3+3)/63=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{7}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the basic concept of probability and how it relates to the given problem?\n2. What does it mean for Leah to pick a random three-second time interval to watch the light? How does this relate to calculating the probability of the color changes while she is watching?\n3. What is the cycle of the traffic light? How long does it take for the light to go through the entire cycle?\n4. How can we determine the probability that Leah sees the color change? What approach can we take to solve this problem?\n5. What are the possible color changes that Leah can observe while watching the light? Can we calculate the probability of each individual color change occurring during her chosen time interval?\n6. How can we account for the overlapping time intervals when Leah can see the color change? Can we calculate the total probability of all possible color changes occurring?"
