    "problem": "How many three-digit whole numbers have at least one 7 or at least one 9 as digits?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We know that there are a total of $999 - 100 + 1 = 900$ three digit numbers.  If we try to count how many have at least one 7 or one 9 as digits directly, we'll run into a load of casework.  So instead, we proceed by counting the complement, the number of three digit numbers having no 7s or 9s as digits.  We can choose the first digit in 7 ways (anything except 0, 7, 9) and the second and third digits in 8 ways each.  This leads to a total of $7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8 = 448$ numbers that we don't want, leaving us with an answer of $900 - 448 = \\boxed{452}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain why we count the complement of the desired numbers? What advantages does this approach offer?\n2. How many choices do we have for the first digit? Why do we exclude 0, 7, and 9?\n3. How many choices do we have for the second and third digits? Why?\n4. By multiplying the number of choices for each digit, what are we calculating in this problem?\n5. Why do we subtract the count of numbers we don't want from the total number of three-digit numbers?\n6. Can you think of any other scenarios or problems where counting the complement might be useful?\n7. Is there a different approach we could use to solve this problem? How does it compare to the approach we took?"
