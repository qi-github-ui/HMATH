    "solution": "Since $D$ and $C$ are located on segment $\\overline{AB}$, if $AB=3AD$, then $\\overline{AD}$ must take up $1/3$ of line segment $\\overline{AB}$. Similarly, since $AB=6BC$, $\\overline{BC}$ must take up $1/6$ of line segment $\\overline{AB}$. Then, $\\overline{CD}$ is the remaining segment of $\\overline{AB}$ and takes up $1-1/3 - 1/6 = 1/2$ of the total length of $\\overline{AB}$. Thus, if we were to choose a random point on segment $\\overline{AB}$, there would be a $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ probability that it is between points $C$ and $D$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you describe the given problem in your own words?\n2. Can you explain the relationship between points A, B, C, and D?\n3. How do you interpret the statement \"AB = 3AD = 6BC\" in terms of the lengths of the line segments?\n4. Can you determine the lengths of AD, BC, and CD based on the given information? If so, what are they?\n5. If a point is randomly chosen on segment AB, what are the possible locations where it could be?\n6. What is the probability that the randomly chosen point is between points C and D? How did you arrive at that answer?\n7. Is there any other way to approach this problem to determine the probability? If yes, can you explain it?\n8. Can you think of a similar scenario where concepts of probability can be applied in a different context?"
