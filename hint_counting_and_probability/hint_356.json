    "problem": "Two distinct positive integers from 1 to 50 inclusive are chosen.  Let the sum of the integers equal $S$ and the product equal $P$.  What is the probability that $P+S$ is one less than a multiple of 5?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are a total of $\\binom{50}{2}=1225$ ways to choose the two positive integers.  Call these integers $a$ and $b$.  The problem asks what the probability is that: $$ab+a+b=n-1$$where $n$ is a multiple of 5.  We can add one to each side of this equation and factor: $$ab+a+b+1=(a+1)(b+1)=n$$Now, we need to count the number of values of $a$ and $b$ such that $(a+1)(b+1)$ is a multiple of 5.  This will happen if at least one of the factors is a multiple of 5, which will mean $a$ or $b$ is one less than a multiple of 5.\n\nThere are 10 integers from 1 to 50 inclusive that are 1 less than a multiple of 5: $4,9,14, \\dots, 49$.  So, the number of ways to choose $a$ and $b$ so the product is $\\textit{not}$ a multiple of 5 is $\\binom{40}{2}=780$.  Therefore, there are $1225-780=445$ ways to choose $a$ and $b$ that do satisfy the requirement, which gives a probability of: $$\\frac{445}{1225}=\\boxed{\\frac{89}{245}}$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking for? Can you rephrase it in your own words? \n2. What does it mean for a number to be one less than a multiple of 5? Can you think of some examples?\n3. Let's take a step back and look at the given information. How many ways are there to choose two distinct positive integers from 1 to 50? Can you explain why it is $\\binom{50}{2}$?\n4. Based on the given information, we can express the sum of the two integers as $S$ and the product as $P$. Can you write an equation relating $S$ and $P$?\n5. How can we simplify the equation $ab + a + b + 1 = (a + 1)(b + 1) = n$? Can you explain each step in the simplification process?\n6. Now let's focus on finding the number of ways for $(a + 1)(b + 1)$ to be a multiple of 5. Can you think of any cases where this might happen?\n7. How many integers from 1 to 50 are one less than a multiple of 5? Can you list them?\n8. Why do we count the number of ways for $(a + 1)(b + 1)$ to $\\textit{not}$ be a multiple of 5? Can you explain the reasoning behind this approach?\n9. Based on our counting, how many ways are there to choose $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the requirement? Can you explain why it is $\\binom{40}{2}$?\n10. Finally, what is the probability that $P + S$ is one less than a multiple of 5 based on our counting? Can you explain the steps to arrive at this probability?"
