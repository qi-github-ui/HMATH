    "problem": "The digits 2, 3, 5 and 7 are arranged randomly to form a four-digit number. What is the probability that the number is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The number formed is odd if and only if its units digit is not 2. Since the digits 2, 3, 5, and 7 are arranged randomly, the probability that 2 is the units digit is 1/4. Therefore, the probability that the number is odd is $1-1/4=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for a number to be odd?\n2. How many different numbers can be formed using the digits 2, 3, 5, and 7?\n3. In how many of those numbers is the units digit 2?\n4. If the units digit is not 2, would the number be odd or even?\n5. What is the probability that the units digit is 2? How did you arrive at this probability?\n6. To find the probability that the number is odd, what do we need to do with the probability of the units digit being 2?\n7. Can you simplify the expression for the probability of the number being odd?"
