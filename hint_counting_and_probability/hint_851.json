    "problem": "George flips an unfair coin 7 times. The coin has a $\\frac{1}{4}$ probability of coming up heads and a $\\frac{3}{4}$ probability of coming up tails. What is the probability that he flips exactly 2 tails?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The probability that two coins land tails and five coins land heads, in some order, is $\\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^5=\\frac{9}{16384}$. Any two of the seven coins can be tails, so this can happen in $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ ways. Therefore, the probability that exactly two coins come up tails is $21 \\cdot \\frac{9}{16384}=\\boxed{\\frac{189}{16384}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the probability of getting tails on a single flip of the unfair coin?\n2. How many times does George flip the coin?\n3. How can we calculate the probability of getting exactly 2 tails in 7 flips?\n4. Can the two tails occur in any order, or is there a specific order in which they must appear?\n5. How can we calculate the probability of getting tails on 2 specific flips and heads on the remaining 5 flips?\n6. What is the formula for calculating the probability of a specific sequence of coin flips?\n7. How many ways can we choose 2 flips out of the 7 flips to be tails?\n8. How can we calculate this combination using the binomial coefficient?\n9. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 tails in 7 flips, considering all possible combinations?\n10. How can we calculate the final probability by multiplying the probability of each combination by the number of ways it can occur?\n11. What is the significance of the result being expressed as a fraction?\n12. Can we simplify or reduce the fraction to a simpler form?\n13. How would the probability change if the coin were fair instead of unfair?\n14. Can we generalize this approach to calculate probabilities for different numbers of tails in a given number of flips?\n15. Are there any other factors or variables that could affect the probability in this scenario?"
