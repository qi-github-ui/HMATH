    "problem": "Gretchen has eight socks, two of each color: magenta, cyan, black, and white. She randomly draws four socks. What is the probability that she has exactly one pair of socks with the same color?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are a total of $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$ combinations of socks. We seek combinations that have one pair of socks with the same color and two separate socks with different colors for a total of three colors. There are $\\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose three colors. From each combination of three colors, there are $\\binom{3}{1}$ ways to choose a color for the only pair of socks.  There are 2 socks to choose from for each of the colors that only appear once among the four socks she chooses.  Therefore, there are $\\binom{4}{3}\\binom{3}{1}\\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 48$ ways to choose an appropriate combination of socks. The probability of choosing such a combination is $\\frac{48}{70} = \\boxed{\\frac{24}{35}}$.",

How many socks does Gretchen need to randomly draw?\n4. What does it mean for Gretchen to have exactly one pair of socks with the same color?\n5. How can we calculate the total number of combinations of socks that Gretchen can draw?\n6. How do we determine the combinations that have exactly one pair of socks with the same color?\n7. Can you explain the reasoning behind the formula used to calculate the number of these combinations?\n8. How can we calculate the probability of Gretchen drawing a combination with exactly one pair of socks with the same color?\n9. Can you simplify the expression representing the probability?\n10. Based on your calculations, what is the probability that Gretchen has exactly one pair of socks with the same color?"
