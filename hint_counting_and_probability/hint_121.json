    "problem": "Two standard dice are rolled. What is the expected number of 1's obtained? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The probability of rolling a number other than 1 on one die is $\\frac{5}{6}$, so the probability of rolling zero 1's on two dice is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{36}$. The probability of rolling a 1 on one die is $\\frac{1}{6}$, so the probability of rolling 1's on two dice (for a total of two 1's) is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{36}$. Since the only other possibility is rolling exactly one 1, the probability of rolling one 1 is $1-\\frac{25}{36}-\\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{10}{36}$. We find the expected number of 1's to be $E = \\frac{1}{36} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{10}{36} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{25}{36} \\cdot 0 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the expected value means in the context of rolling two dice?\n2. What is the probability of not rolling a 1 on one die? How does this relate to the probability of not rolling any 1's on two dice?\n3. What is the probability of rolling a 1 on one die? How does this relate to the probability of rolling two 1's on two dice?\n4. How can we calculate the probability of rolling exactly one 1 on two dice?\n5. Why is the probability of rolling one 1 calculated as 1 minus the probability of rolling zero 1's and the probability of rolling two 1's?\n6. What are the individual probabilities for each outcome (0 1's, 1 1, 2 1's) in this scenario?\n7. How can we calculate the expected number of 1's obtained in this scenario using the probabilities we have determined?\n8. Can you demonstrate the calculation of the expected value step by step with the given probabilities?\n9. How does the result of 1/3 as the expected value make sense in the context of rolling two dice?"
