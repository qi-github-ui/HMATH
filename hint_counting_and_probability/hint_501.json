    "solution": "Because the octahedron is symmetric and all vertices have the same number of edges, we can assume that the first vertex we choose is the top one. If we do not choose this vertex, we can simply rotate the octahedron so that we have. From here, there are 5 other vertices. 4 of them share an edge with the vertex we have already chosen, so the probability that the 2 vertices chosen form an edge is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you describe a regular octahedron?\n2. What does it mean for two vertices to be the endpoints of an edge of the octahedron?\n3. Can you explain why the top vertex is the one we can assume we choose?\n4. How many other vertices are there that we can choose as the second vertex?\n5. How many of those vertices share an edge with the top vertex?\n6. If we choose one of those shared vertices as the second vertex, what is the probability that the chosen vertices form an edge?\n7. Can you think of a different approach to calculate the probability?\n8. What would be the probability if the octahedron was not regular? "
