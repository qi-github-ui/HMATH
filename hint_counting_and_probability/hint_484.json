    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we only have to consider the number of balls in the boxes.  The arrangements for balls in boxes are $$(4,0,0),(3,1,0),(2,2,0),(2,1,1).$$However, since the boxes are distinguishable, we must also consider the arrangement of balls in the boxes in order.\n\nFor (4,0,0), there are $3$ different ways (box $\\#1$ can have 4, box $\\#2$ can have 4, or box $\\#3$ can have 4).\n\nFor (3,1,0), there are $3! = 6$ ways: we have 3 choices for the box containing 3 balls, then 2 choices for the box containing 1 ball.\n\nFor (2,2,0) there are $3$ ways: we must choose the box which remains empty.\n\nFor (2,1,1) there are $3$ ways: we must choose the box which gets 2 balls.\n\nThis gives a total of $3 + 6 + 3 + 3 = \\boxed{15}$ arrangements.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the question is asking in your own words?\n2. How many balls and boxes are there in this problem? Are they distinguishable or indistinguishable?\n3. If the balls were distinguishable, how would that change the number of arrangements?\n4. Can you list all the possible arrangements for the balls in the boxes?\n5. How many ways are there to arrange the balls in each possible arrangement, taking into account the distinguishability of the boxes?\n6. Can you use a formula to calculate the total number of arrangements, given the arrangements and their corresponding number of ways?\n7. What other types of combinatorial problems can you think of that involve distinguishability and/or indistinguishability? How would you approach solving them?"
