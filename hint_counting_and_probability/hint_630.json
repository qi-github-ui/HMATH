    "problem": "A board game spinner is divided into three regions labeled $A$, $B$ and $C$.  The probability of the arrow stopping on region $A$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$ and on region $B$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.  What is the probability of the arrow stopping on region $C$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since the sum of the three probabilities is 1, the probability of stopping on region $C$ is $1 - \\frac{1}{3} -\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{6}{6} - \\frac{2}{6} - \\frac{3}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of regions on the spinner?\n2. What is the probability of NOT landing on each individual region?\n3. How can we use the probabilities of regions A and B to find the probability of region C?\n4. Is it possible for the probability of region C to be greater than the probabilities of regions A or B? Why or why not?\n5. If we were to spin the board game spinner multiple times, what would be the expected frequency of landing on region C?\n6. Is it possible to divide the spinner into more than three regions while still maintaining a total probability of 1? How would this affect the probability of landing on each region?"
