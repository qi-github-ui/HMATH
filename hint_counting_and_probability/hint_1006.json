    "problem": "If $m$ and $n$ are odd integers, how many terms in the expansion of $(m+n)^6$ are odd?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "By the binomial theorem, $(m+n)^6$ expands as \\begin{align*}\n\\binom60m^6+\\binom61m^5n&+\\binom62m^4n^2+\\binom63m^3n^3\\\\\n&+\\binom64m^2n^4+\\binom65mn^5+\\binom66n^6.\n\\end{align*} Since $m$ and $n$ are odd, each of these terms is odd if and only if the binomial coefficient is odd. Since $\\binom60=\\binom66=1$, $\\binom61=\\binom65=6$, $\\binom62=\\binom64=15$, and $\\binom63=20$, exactly $\\boxed{4}$ of these terms are odd.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How does the expression $(m+n)^6$ expand using the binomial theorem?\n2. Are the coefficients in front of each term in the expansion odd or even?\n3. What are the values of the binomial coefficients in the expansion?\n4. Can you explain why each term is odd if and only if the binomial coefficient is odd?\n5. How many terms in the expansion have odd coefficients?\n6. Can you explain how you arrived at your answer?"
