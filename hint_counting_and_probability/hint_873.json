    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 16 multiples of 3 between 1 and 50 ($1\\cdot 3$ through $16\\cdot 3$), and $50-16=34$ numbers which are not multiples of 3. The probability that neither of the numbers Ben chooses is a multiple of 3 is $\\left( \\frac{34}{50} \\right)^2=\\frac{1156}{2500}$. Therefore, the probability that at least one of the numbers that Ben chooses is a multiple of 3 is $1-\\frac{1156}{2500}=\\frac{1344}{2500}=\\boxed{\\frac{336}{625}}$.",

How many multiples of 3 are there between 1 and 50, inclusive?\n4. What is the probability that the first number Ben chooses is not a multiple of 3?\n5. What is the probability that the second number Ben chooses is not a multiple of 3, given that the first number he chose was not a multiple of 3?\n6. What is the probability that neither of the numbers Ben chooses is a multiple of 3?\n7. How can we use the result from Step 6 to find the probability that at least one of the numbers Ben chooses is a multiple of 3?\n8. What is the final probability of at least one of the numbers Ben chooses being a multiple of 3?"
