    "problem": "Nathan will roll two six-sided dice. What is the probability that he will roll a number less than three on the first die and a number greater than three on the second die? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "For the first die to be less than three, it must be a 1 or a 2, which occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$. For the second die to be greater than 3, it must be a 4 or a 5 or a 6, which occurs with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of both of these events occuring, as they are independent, is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step in calculating the probability of Nathan rolling a number less than three on the first die and a number greater than three on the second die?\n2. Why do we consider the numbers 1 and 2 as the options for the first die to be less than three?\n3. What are the possible outcomes for the second die to be greater than three?\n4. Why do we say that the events of the first and second dice are independent?\n5. How do we calculate the probability of both events occurring?\n6. Can you think of any other scenarios where we need to calculate the probability of two independent events? How would you approach solving them?"
