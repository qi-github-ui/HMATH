    "problem": "In Pascal's Triangle, each number is the sum of the number just above it and to the left and the number just above it and to the right. So the middle number in Row 2 is $2$ because $1+1=2.$ What is the sum of the numbers in Row 8 of Pascal's Triangle?\n\n\\begin{tabular}{rccccccccccc}\nRow 0:& & & & & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\nRow 1:& & & & & 1 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\nRow 2:& & & & 1 & & 2 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\nRow 3:& & & 1 & & 3 & & 3 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\nRow 4:& & 1 & & 4 & & 6 & & 4 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\nRow 5:& 1 & & 5 & & 10 & & 10 & & 5 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\n\\end{tabular}",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The most obvious way to solve this problem would be to list Pascal's Triangle to Row 8.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{rccccccccccccccccc}\nRow 0:& & & & & & & & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\nRow 1:& & & & & & & & 1 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\nRow 2:& & & & & & & 1 & & 2 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\nRow 3:& & & & & & 1 & & 3 & & 3 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\nRow 4:& & & & & 1 & & 4 & & 6 & & 4 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\nRow 5:& & & & 1 & & 5 & & 10 & & 10 & & 5 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\nRow 6:& & & 1 & & 6 & & 15 & & 20 & & 15 & & 6 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\nRow 7:& & 1 & & 7 & & 21 & & 35 & & 35 & & 21 & & 7 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\nRow 8:& 1 & & 8 & & 28 & & 56 & & 70 & & 56 & & 28 & & 8 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\n\\end{tabular}\n\nWe then add $1+8+28+56+70+56+28+8+1=\\boxed{256}.$\n\nAn interesting note: We can sum the numbers in some of the smaller rows of Pascal's Triangle. Row 0 sums to $1,$ Row 1 sums to $1+1=2,$ Row 2 sums to $1+2+1=4,$ Row 3 sums to $1+3+3+1=8,$ and Row 4 sums to $1+4+6+4+1=16.$ We start to notice a pattern: the sum of the numbers in Row $n$ of Pascal's Triangle equals $2^{n}.$ Sure enough, the sum of the numbers in Row 8 is $256,$ which is $2^{8}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe how Pascal's Triangle is constructed? Are there any patterns or rules that you notice?\n2. Why do you think Pascal's Triangle is constructed in the way it is? What is the significance of the numbers being the sum of the numbers above and adjacent to them?\n3. How can we determine the sum of the numbers in Row 8 without listing out the entire triangle? Are there any patterns or formulas that can help us?\n4. Can you find a pattern or formula for the sum of the numbers in Row $n$ of Pascal's Triangle? If so, how can we prove that it works?\n5. How does the sum of the numbers in Row 8 relate to the sum of the numbers in Rows 0 to 7? Can we make any conjectures or observations about this relationship?\n6. Are there any real-world applications or uses for Pascal's Triangle and its sums? Can you think of any situations or problems where this concept might be useful?"
