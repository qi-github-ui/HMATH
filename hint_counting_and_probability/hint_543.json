    "problem": "How many subsets of the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ contain the number 5?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Solution 1: For each of 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can either choose to include the number in the set, or choose to exclude it.  We therefore have 2 choices for each of these 4 numbers, which gives us a total of $2^4 = \\boxed{16}$ different subsets we can form.\n\nSolution 2: We can have either 5 by itself, 5 with one other number from the four, 5 with two other numbers, 5 with three other numbers, or 5 with all four other numbers. The number of ways to form a subset with 5 by itself is $\\binom{4}{0}$. The number of ways to form a subset with 5 and one other number is $\\binom{4}{1}$. Similarly, the number of ways to form a subset with 5 and two other numbers is $\\binom{4}{2}$, with three other numbers is $\\binom{4}{3}$, and with all four other numbers is $\\binom{4}{4}$. Thus, our answer is $1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = \\boxed{16}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you restate the problem in your own words?\n2. What is a subset? How many subsets are there for a set with n elements?\n3. How many ways are there to form a subset of size 5 with the given set? \n4. How many ways are there to form a subset of size 4 containing the number 5? \n5. Can you explain the reasoning behind Solution 1? How does it relate to binary numbers? \n6. Can you explain the reasoning behind Solution 2? How does it relate to counting with combinations? \n7. Are there any other methods you can think of to solve this problem? \n8. What if we had a set with 6 elements? Can you generalize your approach to find the number of subsets containing a specific element for a set with n elements?"
