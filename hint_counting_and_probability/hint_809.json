    "problem": "Jeff decides to play with a Magic 8 Ball. Each time he asks it a question, it has a 2/5 chance of giving him a positive answer. If he asks it 5 questions, what is the probability that it gives him exactly 2 positive answers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose 2 of 5 questions to give a positive response to. For each choice, there is a probability of $\\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^3$ that those 2 questions will yield a positive answer and the other 3 will not. Therefore, the total probability that exactly 2 of questions give a positve answer is $10 \\left( \\frac{2}{5} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{216}{625}}$.",

How can we calculate the probability of getting exactly 2 positive answers out of 5 questions using combinatorics?\n6. Why do we use the formula $\\binom{n}{k}$ to calculate the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items?\n7. How do we calculate the probability of an event happening multiple times using the multiplication principle?\n8. What is the final probability of Jeff getting exactly 2 positive answers from the Magic 8 Ball if we apply the formulas from questions 5 and 7?"
