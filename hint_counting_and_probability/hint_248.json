    "problem": "Suppose two distinct integers are chosen from between 5 and 17, inclusive.  What is the probability that their product is odd?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 13 integers between 5 and 17 inclusive, so there are $\\binom{13}{2} = 78$ ways to choose two of them without regard to order.  In order for the product of two integers to be odd, both of the integers themselves must be odd. There are 7 odd integers between 5 and 17 inclusive, so there are $\\binom72 = 21$ ways to choose two of them without regard to order.  Therefore, the desired probability is $\\dfrac{21}{78} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{26}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what is meant by \"probability\" in this context?\n2. How many integers are there between 5 and 17 inclusive? How did you arrive at that number?\n3. Why do we need to consider choosing two distinct integers? What happens if we choose the same integer twice?\n4. How many ways can we choose two distinct integers from the given range without regard to order? Can you explain your reasoning?\n5. In order for the product of two integers to be odd, what condition(s) must be met in terms of the integers themselves?\n6. How many odd integers are there between 5 and 17 inclusive? Can you explain how you determined that number?\n7. What is the relationship between choosing two odd integers and the desired probability? Can you explain why?\n8. How many ways can we choose two odd integers without regard to order? Can you explain your reasoning?\n9. Using the information we've gathered, what is the probability that the product of two integers chosen is odd? Can you show the calculations?"
