    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The only way in which there won't be two dice of the same number is if for each number between 1 and 6 there is exactly one die displaying that number. If we line the dice up, there are a total of $6!$ ways in which we could order 6 dice all displaying different numbers and a total of $6^6$ possible outcomes since each of the 6 dice can have 6 outcomes and all of the rolls are determined independently. That means that the probability of all of the dice showing different numbers is $\\dfrac{6!}{6^6}=\\dfrac{5}{324}$, so the probability that we want is $1-\\dfrac{5}{324}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{319}{324}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the main scenario we want to consider in order to find the probability that at least two dice show the same number?\n2. If we want at least two dice to show the same number, what is the complementary scenario we should consider instead?\n3. How can we determine the total number of possible outcomes if all 6 dice show different numbers? How does this relate to the concept of permutations?\n4. What is the total number of possible outcomes when rolling 6 fair 6-sided dice? How does this relate to the concept of independent events?\n5. How can we express the probability of all 6 dice showing different numbers in terms of these total numbers of outcomes?\n6. Can you calculate the probability of all 6 dice showing different numbers? What is the result?\n7. How can we find the probability that at least two dice show the same number by using the probability of all 6 dice showing different numbers?\n8. Can you calculate the probability that at least two dice show the same number? What is the result?"
