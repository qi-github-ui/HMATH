Can you identify any rule or relationship between the numbers in each row of Pascal's Triangle?\n3. How can you determine if a number in Pascal's Triangle is even or odd?\n4. By listing the first 10 rows of Pascal's Triangle, can you identify the even numbers?\n5. Can you find a systematic approach to counting the number of even numbers in the top 10 rows of the triangle?\n6. How can you use the information from the marked even numbers in the diagram to calculate the total count of even numbers?\n7. Can you explain why the count of even numbers in the top 10 rows of Pascal's Triangle is 22?\n8. Can you generalize your findings to predict the number of even numbers in larger sections of Pascal's Triangle?"
