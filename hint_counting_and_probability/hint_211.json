    "problem": "Suppose 5 different integers are randomly chosen from between 20 and 69, inclusive.  What is the probability that they each have a different tens digit?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "In this set of integers, there are 5 tens digits: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.  If 5 integers all have different tens digits, then there must be exactly one integer among the 5 with each tens digit.  Since there are 10 different integers for each tens digit, the number of ways to pick, without regard to order, 5 different integers with different tens digits is $10^5$.  The total number of combinations of 5 integers is $\\binom{50}{5}$.  So the probability that 5 integers drawn all have the different tens digits is $$ \\frac{10^5}{\\binom{50}{5}} = \\frac{100000}{2118760} = \\boxed{\\frac{2500}{52969}}. $$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you restate the problem in your own words?\n2. What are the five possible tens digits of the chosen integers?\n3. What is the total number of ways to choose 5 integers without any restrictions?\n4. Why must there be exactly one integer with each tens digit if they all have different tens digits?\n5. How many options are there for each tens digit to choose from?\n6. What is the probability that 5 integers drawn all have different tens digits?"
