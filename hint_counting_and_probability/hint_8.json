    "problem": "Sue owns 11 pairs of shoes: six identical black pairs, three identical brown pairs and two identical gray pairs. If she picks two shoes at random, what is the probability that they are the same color and that one is a left shoe and the other is a right shoe? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "We will consider these by the cases of what our first shoe selection is. If our first shoe is black, which happens with probability $\\frac{12}{22}$, then our second shoe will be black and for the opposite foot with probability $\\frac{6}{21}$. Likewise, for brown shoes, our probability is the product $\\frac{6}{22} \\cdot \\frac{3}{21}$. And for gray, $\\frac{4}{22} \\cdot \\frac{2}{21}$. So the sum is equal to $\\frac{12\\cdot 6 + 6 \\cdot 3 + 4 \\cdot 2}{22 \\cdot 21} = \\frac{98}{33\\cdot 14} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{33}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step we need to take in order to find the probability that Sue picks two shoes of the same color and one is a left shoe and the other is a right shoe?\n2. Can you identify the different cases or scenarios we need to consider in this problem?\n3. Let's consider the case where the first shoe picked is black. What is the probability that the second shoe picked is also black and for the opposite foot?\n4. Now, let's consider the case where the first shoe picked is brown. What is the probability that the second shoe picked is also brown and for the opposite foot?\n5. Finally, let's consider the case where the first shoe picked is gray. What is the probability that the second shoe picked is also gray and for the opposite foot?\n6. How can we calculate the overall probability of picking two shoes of the same color and one is a left shoe and the other is a right shoe?\n7. Can you simplify the fractional expression to express the overall probability as a common fraction?"
