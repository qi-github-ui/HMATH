    "problem": "A board game spinner is divided into three parts labeled $A$, $B$  and $C$. The probability of the spinner landing on $A$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$ and the probability of the spinner landing on $B$ is $\\frac{5}{12}$.  What is the probability of the spinner landing on $C$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "The spinner is guaranteed to land on exactly one of the three regions, so we know that the sum of the probabilities of it landing in each region will be 1. If we let the probability of it landing in region $C$ be $x$, we then have the equation $1 = \\frac{5}{12}+\\frac{1}{3}+x$, from which we have $x=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of regions on the spinner?\n2. If the spinner is guaranteed to land on one of the three regions, what can we say about the sum of the probabilities of it landing in each region?\n3. How can we represent the probability of the spinner landing on region C using a variable?\n4. What equation can we set up to represent the relationship between the probabilities of landing in each region?\n5. How can we solve the equation to find the value of the probability for landing on region C?\n6. What does the obtained probability value tell us about the likelihood of the spinner landing on region C?\n7. Can you think of any similar probability problems where we can apply the same kind of reasoning and steps?"
