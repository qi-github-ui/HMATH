    "problem": "Assuming that the birth of a boy or a girl is equally likely, what is the probability that the three children in a family include at least one boy and one girl? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are only two ways for a family of three to not have at least one boy and at least one girl: either the family is all boys, or it is all girls. The probability that a family is all boys is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^3=\\frac{1}{8}$, and the probability that a family is all girls is also $\\frac{1}{8}$. Therefore, the probability that a family of three is neither all girls nor all boys is $1-\\frac{1}{8}-\\frac{1}{8}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the question is asking and what \"at least one boy and one girl\" means in this context?\n2. How many possible outcomes are there when a family has three children? \n3. How many outcomes would result in a family having all boys or all girls? \n4. What is the probability of a family having all boys or all girls? \n5. How can we find the probability of a family having at least one boy and one girl? \n6. Can you determine the probability of a family having at least one boy and one girl using the information we've discussed so far?"
