    "problem": "I have two 20-sided dice that each have 4 maroon sides, 7 teal sides, 8 cyan sides, and one sparkly side. If I roll both dice, what is the probability they come up the same?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "This problem requires a little bit of casework.  There are four ways in which the dice can both show the same thing: if they both show maroon, both show teal, both show cyan or both show sparkly. The probability of getting maroon is $\\dfrac{4}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show maroon is $\\left(\\dfrac{4}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{16}{400}$. Similarly, the probability of getting teal is $\\dfrac{7}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show teal is $\\left(\\dfrac{7}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{49}{400}$, the probability of getting cyan is $\\dfrac{8}{20}$, so the probability that they will both show cyan is $\\left(\\dfrac{8}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{64}{400}$ and the probability of getting sparkly is $\\dfrac{1}{20}$, so the probability that they will both get sparkly is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{20}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{1}{400}$. So our answer is $\\dfrac{16}{400}+\\dfrac{49}{400}+\\dfrac{64}{400}+\\dfrac{1}{400}=\\frac{130}{400}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{40}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the possible outcomes when rolling the two 20-sided dice?\n2. How many maroon sides are there on each 20-sided dice? How does this affect the probability of getting maroon on both dice?\n3. Can both dice show teal? If so, what is the probability of this happening?\n4. Are there any teal sides on the dice that could match with each other? How does this affect the probability of getting teal on both dice?\n5. What about cyan? How many sides are there for cyan on each dice? What is the probability of getting cyan on both dice?\n6. Is there a side that is unique to both dice? What are the chances of both dice showing this unique side?\n7. How can we calculate the overall probability of the two dice showing the same outcome?"
