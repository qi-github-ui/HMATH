    "problem": "A palindrome is an integer that reads the same forward and backward, such as 3663. What percent of the palindromes between 100 and 500 contain at least one 5?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since none of the palindromes between 100 and 500 begin with a 5, the only place a 5 can appear is in the tens digit.  Therefore, there are 4 palindromes between 100 and 500 with a 5: 151, 252, 353, and 454.  To count the total number of palindromes, we observe that there are 4 choices to make for the first/last digit and 10 choices to make for the middle digit.  Therefore, the percentage of palindromes that contain 5 as a digit is $\\frac{4}{4\\cdot 10}=\\boxed{10\\%}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a palindrome is and provide an example?\n2. Based on the given information, how can we determine which palindromes between 100 and 500 contain at least one 5?\n3. Why is it stated that none of the palindromes between 100 and 500 begin with a 5? What does this imply for finding palindromes with a 5?\n4. Considering that the only place a 5 can appear is in the tens digit, how many palindromes between 100 and 500 have a 5 in the tens digit?\n5. How can we count the total number of palindromes between 100 and 500?\n6. Why do we have 4 choices for the first/last digit and 10 choices for the middle digit when counting the total number of palindromes?\n7. How can we calculate the percentage of palindromes that contain 5 as a digit using the information we have gathered?\n8. Can you express the percentage as a decimal or fraction?\n9. What is the final answer to the problem?"
