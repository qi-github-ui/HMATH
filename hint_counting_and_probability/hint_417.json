    "problem": "My club has 25 members.  In how many ways can I choose members to form a 4-person executive committee?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Choosing a committee is a combination, since the order does not matter. We are choosing a 4-person committee from 25 people, so there are 25 ways to pick the first person, 24 ways to pick the second person, etc.  However, we must divide by $4!$ since order doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22}{4!}=\\boxed{12,\\!650}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many members are in the club?\n2. How many people do you need to choose for the executive committee?\n3. What does it mean for the order not to matter in this problem?\n4. Why do we use combinations rather than permutations to solve this problem?\n5. Can you explain why we divide the number of ways to choose the committee members by 4!?\n6. Can you calculate the value of 4! and explain its significance in this problem?\n7. What is the final answer to the problem? Can you explain how you arrived at that answer?"
