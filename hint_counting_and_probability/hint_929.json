    "problem": "Our water polo team has 15 members.  I want to choose a starting team consisting of 7 players, one of whom will be the goalie (the other six positions are interchangeable, so the order in which they are chosen doesn't matter).  In how many ways can I choose my starting team?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First we choose the goalie, and any of the 15 people can be the goalie. Then we choose 6 more players from the remaining 14 players, which is same as choosing a committee. There are 14 ways to choose the first player, 13 ways to choose the second player, and so on, down to 9 ways to choose the sixth player.  We must then divide by $6!$ since order of the six players doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{6!} =\\boxed{45,\\!045}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step in choosing the starting team?\n2. How many options do we have for choosing the goalie out of the 15 members?\n3. After choosing the goalie, how many players are left to choose from for the remaining 6 positions?\n4. How many ways are there to choose the first player after selecting the goalie?\n5. Can you explain why we multiply the number of ways to choose each player together?\n6. Why do we divide by 6! (6 factorial) in the final calculation?\n7. Can you think of any other scenarios where we might need to use a similar approach to counting combinations?\n8. Can you generalize the formula for choosing a starting team with any number of players and positions?"
