    "problem": "A board game spinner is divided into three regions labeled $A$, $B$ and $C$.  The probability of the arrow stopping on region $A$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and on region $B$ is $\\frac{1}{5}$.  What is the probability of the arrow stopping on region $C$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since the sum of the three probabilities is 1, the probability of stopping on region $C$ is $1 - \\frac{1}{2} -\n\\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{10}{10} - \\frac{5}{10} - \\frac{2}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you restate the problem in your own words to ensure you understand it?\n2. How would you approach finding the probability of the arrow stopping on region C? What steps would you take?\n3. Why is it important to find the total probability of stopping on regions A and B first before determining the probability for region C?\n4. Can you explain why the sum of the three probabilities must equal 1?\n5. If the probability of stopping on region A is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and on region B is $\\frac{1}{5}$, what would the probability need to be for the arrow to stop on region C in order for the sum to equal 1?\n6. How did you calculate the probability of stopping on region C using the given probabilities for regions A and B?\n7. Are there any other ways to calculate the probability of stopping on region C? If so, what are they?\n8. Can you think of a real-life scenario where understanding and calculating probabilities, like in this problem, would be useful?"
