    "problem": "Each page number of a 488-page book is printed one time in the book.  The first page is page 1 and the last page is page 488. When printing all of the page numbers, how many more 4's are printed than 8's?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Insert leading zeros if necessary to give every page number three digits.  Every digit is used an equal number of times in writing the digits 00, 01, 02, ..., 98, 99, so from page 1 to page 399, the number of 4's used and the number of 8's used are equal.\n\nFrom page 400 to page 488, there are 89 appearances of 4 as a hundreds digit versus 0 appearances of 8 as a hundreds digit.  All 10 numbers 440, 441, ..., 449 with 4 as the tens digit are printed, whereas only the 9 numbers 480, 481, ..., 488 with 8 as the tens digit are printed.  So 4 is used one more time than 8 as a tens digit.  Four and 8 appear 9 times each as a units digit in the numbers 400, 401, ..., 488, so there are no extra 4's in the units place.  In total, $89+1+0=\\boxed{90}$ more 4's are printed than 8's.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of pages in the book?\n2. Can you explain the pattern of how the page numbers are printed? How are the leading zeros used?\n3. How many digits are used to represent each page number? Why is it important to have three digits for each page number?\n4. From page 1 to page 399, are the numbers of 4's and 8's used in the page numbers equal? Why or why not?\n5. From page 400 to page 488, how many times is the digit 4 used as the hundreds digit, and how many times is the digit 8 used as the hundreds digit? Explain your reasoning.\n6. From page 400 to page 488, how many times is the digit 4 used as the tens digit, and how many times is the digit 8 used as the tens digit? Can you calculate this?\n7. Are there any extra 4's or 8's used in the units digit from page 400 to page 488? Why or why not?\n8. Finally, how many more 4's are printed than 8's in total? Can you explain your answer based on your findings from the previous questions?"
