    "problem": "There are two colors Jessica can use to color this 2 by 2 grid. If non-overlapping regions that share a side cannot be the same color, how many possible ways are there for Jessica to color the grid?\n\n[asy]\nsize(101);\ndraw(unitsquare);\ndraw((0,.5)--(1,.5));\ndraw((.5,0)--(.5,1));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,1),NW); label(\"$B$\",(1,1),NE); label(\"$C$\",(1,0),SE); label(\"$D$\",(0,0),SW);\n[/asy]",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Because non-overlapping regions that share a side cannot be the same color, the only way to color the grid is to have diagonal squares sharing the same color. So, Jessica can either color the top left and bottom right squares with color $1$ and the top right and bottom left squares with color $2$, or color the top left and bottom right squares with color $2$ and the top left and bottom right squares with color $1$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ ways in which to color the grid.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the main restriction for coloring the grid? Can you explain why non-overlapping regions sharing a side cannot have the same color?\n2. Based on the given restriction, how many colors can Jessica use to color each square? Why?\n3. How many possible color choices are there for the top left square? What about the top right, bottom left, and bottom right squares? Explain your reasoning.\n4. How can we determine the total number of possible ways to color the grid using these color choices for each square?\n5. Can you think of another way to visualize the coloring possibilities for the grid? How does it relate to the previous approach?\n6. Can you generalize this concept to a larger grid size, such as a 3 by 3 grid? How would the number of possible ways to color the grid change?"
