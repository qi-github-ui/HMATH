    "problem": "Every morning when Tim wakes up, he groggily searches around his sock drawer and picks two socks randomly. If he has 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks in his drawer, what is the probability that he picks a matching pair?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Tim has 18 total socks, so there are $\\binom{18}{2} = 153$ ways for him to pick 2 of them. There are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 10 gray-bottomed socks, and $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways for him to pick 2 of his 8 white-bottom socks, for a total of $45 + 28 = 73$ ways for him to pick a matching pair. So the probability he picks a matching pair is $\\boxed{\\frac{73}{153}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of socks Tim has in his drawer? How did you arrive at this number?\n2. How many socks does Tim pick at a time? Why is this information important?\n3. How many ways are there for Tim to choose 2 socks out of the total number of socks? What formula can be used to calculate this?\n4. How many gray-bottomed socks does Tim have? How many ways are there for him to choose 2 gray-bottomed socks?\n5. How many white-bottomed socks does Tim have? How many ways are there for him to choose 2 white-bottomed socks?\n6. Why did we calculate the number of ways for Tim to choose 2 gray-bottomed socks and 2 white-bottomed socks separately? What is the significance of this?\n7. How many ways are there for Tim to choose a matching pair of socks? How did you calculate this?\n8. What is the probability of Tim picking a matching pair of socks? How did you derive this probability?\n9. Could there be other methods or formulas that can be used to solve this problem? Can you think of any alternative approaches?"
