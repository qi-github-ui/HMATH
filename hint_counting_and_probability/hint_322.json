    "problem": "The product of the digits of 3214 is 24. How many distinct four-digit positive integers are such that the product of their digits equals 12?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We first have to figure out the different groups of 4 one-digit numbers whose product is 12.  We obviously can't use 12 as one of the numbers, nor can we use 9, 8, or 7 (none divides 12).  We can use 6, in which case one of the other numbers is 2 and the other two are 1s.  So, we can have the number 6211, or any number we can form by reordering these digits.  There are $4!$ ways to order these four numbers, but we have to divide by $2!$ because the two 1s are the same, so $4!$ counts each possible number twice.  That gives us $4!/2!=12$ numbers that consist of 6, 2, and two 1s.\n\nNext, we note that we can't have a 5, so we think about 4.  If we have a 4, then the other three numbers are 3, 1, 1.  Just as there are 12 ways to order the digits in 6211, there are 12 ways to order the digits in 4311.  Finally, we check if there are any ways to get a product of 12 with digits that are 3 or less.  There's only one such group, the digits in 3221.  As with 6211 and 4311, there are 12 distinct ways to order the digits in 3221.\n\nCombining our three cases, we have $12+12+12=\\boxed{36}$ possible integers.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information in the problem? Can you restate it in your own words?\n2. What is the main objective of the problem? What are we trying to find?\n3. Let's start by considering the digits involved in the product of 12. Which digits can we use and which ones are not usable? Why?\n4. If we use the digit 6, what are the other three digits we can use to form a number with a product of 12? Can you think of any other numbers that can be formed by reordering these digits?\n5. How many ways can we arrange the digits in a four-digit number using the digits 6, 2, and two 1s? Explain why we have to adjust the counting.\n6. Now, let's consider the case where we have the digit 4. Which digits should accompany the digit 4 to have a product of 12? Can you find any other possible four-digit numbers using these digits?\n7. Similar to the previous case, how many distinct ways can the digits be arranged in a four-digit number using the digits 4, 3, and two 1s? Explain why we have to adjust the counting.\n8. Are there any other sets of digits that can give us a product of 12? If so, what are they and what are the possible four-digit numbers that can be formed?\n9. Finally, let's combine the results from all three cases. How many distinct four-digit positive integers can we form in total?"
