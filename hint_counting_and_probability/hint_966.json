    "problem": "How many positive two-digit integers are there in which each of the two digits is prime?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The prime digits are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Since each of the two digits in the integer can be any of the four prime digits, there are $4\\cdot4=\\boxed{16}$ total such integers.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you define what is meant by a \"two-digit integer\"?\n2. How many prime digits are there?\n3. Can you list the four prime digits?\n4. How many choices does a person have for the tens digit of the two-digit integer? \n5. How many choices does a person have for the units digit of the two-digit integer?\n6. Can you explain why there are exactly 16 positive two-digit integers where each of the two digits is prime?\n7. Are there any other methods that could be used to solve this problem?\n8. Can you provide an example of a similar problem where the same thought process could be applied?"
