    "solution": "We know that we must take a 7 unit path.  If we look at the grid a little more carefully, we can see that our path must consist of 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and we can take those steps in any order.  So in order to specify a path, we must choose 3 of our 7 steps to be `up' (and the other 4 steps will thus be `right').  Hence the number of paths is $$ \\binom{7}{3} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\boxed{35}. $$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the problem statement in your own words?\n2. How many total steps do we need to take to go from point A to point B?\n3. How many steps do we need to go to the right? How many steps do we need to go up?\n4. Why must our path consist of 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up? Can we have a different configuration?\n5. How many different ways can we arrange the steps to the right and the steps up?\n6. Can you explain why we need to choose 3 out of the 7 steps to be \"up\"?\n7. How many ways can we choose 3 steps to be \"up\" out of 7 steps in total?\n8. Can you calculate the value of $\\binom{7}{3}$? What does this value represent?\n9. How can we simplify the expression $\\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}$?\n10. What is the final result? How many different paths can we take from point A to point B?"
