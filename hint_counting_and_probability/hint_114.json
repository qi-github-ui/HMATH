    "problem": "Bob rolls a fair six-sided die each morning. If Bob rolls a composite number, he eats sweetened cereal. If he rolls a prime number, he eats unsweetened cereal. If he rolls a 1, then he rolls again. In a non-leap year, what is the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal?

    "solution": "Bob is equally likely to end up rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Three of these numbers are prime and two are composite, so there is a $\\frac{3}{5}$ chance he will eat unsweetened cereal and a $\\frac{2}{5}$ chance that he will eat sweetened cereal. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, so the expected value of the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal is $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot365=219$ and the expected value of the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal is $\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot365=146$. The difference between 219 days and 146 days is $\\boxed{73}$ days.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the problem in your own words? What is it asking for?\n2. How would you define a prime number and a composite number?\n3. What are the possible outcomes when Bob rolls the die?\n4. How can we calculate the probabilities of eating sweetened and unsweetened cereal?\n5. What does it mean to find the expected value in this context?\n6. How would you calculate the expected value of the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal?\n7. How would you calculate the expected value of the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal?\n8. What is the difference between these two expected values?\n9. Is there a shortcut or pattern we can use to find the difference without calculating each expected value? Why or why not?\n10. Can you think of any other scenarios or problems where we can apply similar probabilistic reasoning?"
