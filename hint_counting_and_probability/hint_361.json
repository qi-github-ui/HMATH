    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We let the $x$-axis represent the time Bob arrives, and the $y$-axis represent the time Alice arrives. Then we shade in the region where Alice arrives after Bob, and mark off the part of that area where Bob arrives before 1:30.\n\n[asy]\nfill((0,0)--(60,60)--(0,60)--cycle, gray(.7));\ndraw((30,0)--(30,60));\nlabel(\"1:30\", (30,0), S);\n\ndraw((0,0)--(60,0)--(60,60)--(0,60));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,60));\nlabel(\"1:00\", (0,0), SW);\nlabel(\"2:00\", (60,0), S);\nlabel(\"2:00\", (0,60), W);\n[/asy]\n\nWe need the ratio of the area of the shaded region to the left of the line marking 1:30 to the area of the whole shaded region. This ratio is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the problem is asking us to find?\n2. How can we represent the possible arrival times of Alice and Bob?\n3. If Alice arrives after Bob, what does that mean in terms of their respective arrival times?\n4. Can you explain why we can represent the possible arrival times as coordinates on a graph?\n5. What does it mean for Bob to arrive before 1:30?\n6. How can we represent the condition \"Bob arrived before 1:30\" on the graph?\n7. What does it mean for Alice to arrive after Bob in terms of the graph?\n8. What does the shaded region represent in the context of the problem?\n9. How can we calculate the probability of Bob arriving before 1:30?\n10. How can we calculate the ratio of the area to the left of the line marking 1:30 to the area of the whole shaded region?\n11. Can you simplify the ratio of the areas to arrive at a probability?"
