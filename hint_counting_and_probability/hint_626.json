    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the problem in your own words? What are we trying to find?\n2. What does it mean for the units digit to be at least twice the tens digit? Can you give an example of a number that satisfies this condition?\n3. Let's consider the different cases based on the choice of the tens digit. For the first case (tens digit = 0), what are the possible units digits that satisfy the given condition?\n4. How many choices do we have for the tens digit in this case? And how many options do we have for the hundreds digit?\n5. Can we generalize this process for the other cases (tens digit = 1, 2, 3, 4)? What are the possible units digits for each case, and how many choices do we have for the tens and hundreds digits?\n6. Based on our analysis, how many numbers do we have in each case? What is the total number of 3-digit numbers that satisfy the given condition?\n7. Can you think of any other problem that involves similar thinking and steps in solving? How would you approach that problem using the same method?"
