    "solution": "Since the balls are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of balls in the different boxes.\n\nThere are $3$ ways to arrange the balls as $(5,0,0)$ (specifically, box 1 can have 5, box 2 can have 5, box 3 can have 5).\n\nThere are $3! = 6$ to arrange $(4,1,0)$ and $3! = 6$ ways to arrange $(3,2,0)$; in each case, we must choose one of the 3 boxes to have the largest number of balls, and also one of the remaining two boxes to be left empty.\n\nHowever, there are only $3$ ways to arrange $(3,1,1)$, and $3$ ways to arrange $(2,2,1)$; in each case, we must choose one box to have the `different' number of balls (3 in the $(3,1,1)$ case and 1 in the $(2,2,1)$ case).\n\nThis gives a total of $3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = \\boxed{21}$ arrangements.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find? \n2. What is the difference between the balls being distinguishable and not distinguishable in this problem?\n3. Why do we only need to count the number of balls in each box if the balls are indistinguishable?\n4. How many ways are there to arrange the balls in the boxes if all 5 balls are in the same box?\n5. How many ways are there to arrange the balls in the boxes if 4 balls are in one box and 1 ball is in another box?\n6. How many ways are there to arrange the balls in the boxes if 3 balls are in one box, 2 balls are in another box, and 0 balls are in the remaining box?\n7. Why are there only 3 ways to arrange the balls if there are 3 balls in one box and 1 ball each in the other two boxes?\n8. How many ways are there to arrange the balls if there are 2 balls in one box, 2 balls in another box, and 1 ball in the remaining box?\n9. Are there any other arrangements of the balls in the boxes that we haven't accounted for? \n10. What is the final answer to the problem and how did we arrive at it?"
