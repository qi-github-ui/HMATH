    "problem": "Assume we have a calendrical system in which leap years happen every four years, no matter what. In a 150-year period, what is the maximum possible number of leap years?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since 150 divided by 4 is 37.5, there are 37 blocks of 4 years in 150 years, plus two extra years.  If we let one of those two extra years be a leap year, and we have one leap year in each of the 37 blocks, then we have 38 leap years.  For example, we can choose a 150-year period that starts with a leap year. For example, 1904-2053 is a 150-year period with 38 leap years $(1904, 1908, \\ldots, 2052)$.  Now we check that under no circumstance will 39 work. We see the optimal situation would be if we start with a leap year and end with a leap year. Leap years happen every four years, so if we start with year $x$, $x$ being a leap year, the $38^{\\text{th}}$ leap year after $x$ is $x+4\\times38 = x+152$, so including $x$ there must be a total of 153 years, which is greater than 150. Therefore no 150-year period will contain 39 leap years. Hence, the answer is $\\boxed{38}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is a leap year? Can you provide a definition?\n2. How often do leap years occur in a calendrical system? Is there a pattern or rule?\n3. How many years are there in a 150-year period?\n4. How many blocks of 4 years are there in a 150-year period?\n5. Can you calculate the number of leap years by dividing 150 by 4? What do you get?\n6. What do you do with the remaining years that cannot form a complete block of 4 years?\n7. How many years can you choose as a leap year within those remaining years?\n8. What happens if you choose a leap year among the remaining years? How many leap years does that give you in total for the 150-year period?\n9. Is there any other optimal strategy to maximize the number of leap years within the 150-year period?\n10. Can you think of any scenarios where there might be fewer than 38 leap years in a 150-year period? How would you determine this?"
