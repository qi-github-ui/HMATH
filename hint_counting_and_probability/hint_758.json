    "problem": "Two distinct numbers are selected simultaneously and at random from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. What is the probability that the smaller one divides the larger one? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 10 pairs of integers that we can potentially select. The easiest way to do this is to simply write them all out: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5). The 4 pairs with 1 as an element all obviously work, as does (2,4), but none of the others do. That means that 5 out of 10 pairs work which gives us a probability of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what is meant by \"selecting two distinct numbers simultaneously and at random\" from a set?\n2. How can we determine the total number of pairs we can potentially select from the set?\n3. Can you explain why the pairs with 1 as an element all work? Are there any other pairs that meet the given condition?\n4. What does it mean for the smaller number to divide the larger number? Can you provide an example of a pair that satisfies this condition?\n5. How many pairs out of the total number satisfy the condition of the smaller number dividing the larger number? How did you arrive at that number?\n6. Can you explain why the probability is equal to the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes?\n7. Can you think of any other scenarios or problems where similar counting and probability principles can be applied?"
