    "solution": "There are 3 choices for the first move starting from $A$. Having made the first move, then there are 2 choices for the second move. Then there is just 1 choice for the third move. Thus, there are $3\\times2\\times1$ or $\\boxed{6}$ paths from $A$ to $B$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many choices do we have for the first move starting from point A?\n2. After making the first move, how many choices do we have for the second move?\n3. What is the number of choices for the third move?\n4. What is the total number of different 3-edge trips from A to B?\n5. How did we calculate the total number of trips using the choices for each move?\n6. Can we generalize this method for finding the number of trips from A to B in a cube of different sizes?\n7. Are there any other paths that we can take from A to B? If so, how many are there?\n8. How does the length of the shortest trip from A to B relate to the number of edges in the cube?"
