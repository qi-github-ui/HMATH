    "problem": "I have 10 distinguishable socks in my drawer: 4 white, 4 brown, and 2 blue.  In how many ways can I choose a pair of socks, provided that I get two socks of the same color?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The socks must be either both white, both brown, or both blue.  If the socks are white, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are brown, there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices.  If the socks are blue, there is $\\binom{2}{2} = 1$ choice.  So the total number of choices for socks is $6 + 6 + 1 = \\boxed{13}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the problem statement and what we're trying to find in this problem?\n2. What does it mean for the socks to be distinguishable? How does this affect the number of choices we have?\n3. In this problem, we are looking for a pair of socks of the same color. Can you explain how we can approach this problem using counting principles?\n4. Let's start by considering the case when the socks are white. How many ways can we choose 2 white socks from the 4 white socks?\n5. Now let's consider the case when the socks are brown. How many ways can we choose 2 brown socks from the 4 brown socks?\n6. What about the case when the socks are blue? How many ways can we choose 2 blue socks from the 2 blue socks?\n7. Can you explain why we need to add up the number of choices for each color to get the total number of choices for socks?\n8. Based on the calculations we made, what is the total number of choices?\n9. Are there any other possible approaches we could use to solve this problem? Can you explain how they might be different from our current approach?\n10. Can you think of any similar problems or scenarios where the same counting principles and steps might be applicable?"
