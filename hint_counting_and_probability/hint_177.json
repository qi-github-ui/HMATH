    "problem": "Each face of a cube is painted either  red or blue, each with probability 1/2. The color of each face is determined independently.  What is the probability that the painted cube can be placed on a horizontal surface so that the four vertical faces are all the same color?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "If the orientation of the cube is fixed, there are $2^6 = 64$ possible arrangements of colors on the faces. There are \\[\n2\\binom{6}{6}=2\n\\]arrangements in which all six faces are the same color and \\[\n2\\binom{6}{5}=12\n\\]arrangements in which exactly five faces have the same color. In each of these cases the cube can be placed so that the four vertical faces have the same color. The only other suitable arrangements have four faces of one color, with the other color on a pair of opposing faces. Since there are three pairs of opposing faces, there are $2(3)=6$ such arrangements. The total number of suitable arrangements is therefore $2+12+6=20$, and the probability is $20/64= \\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of possible arrangements of colors on the faces of the cube?\n2. How many arrangements would have all six faces of the same color?\n3. How many arrangements would have exactly five faces of the same color?\n4. Can you explain why each of these cases would allow the cube to be placed so that the four vertical faces are the same color?\n5. Are there any other arrangements that could also satisfy the condition of having the four vertical faces the same color? If so, can you describe them?\n6. Based on the total number of suitable arrangements and the total number of possible arrangements, what is the probability that the painted cube can be placed as described?"
