    "problem": "A fair, twenty-faced die has $19$ of its faces numbered from $1$ through $19$ and has one blank face. Another fair, twenty-faced die has $19$ of its faces numbered from $1$ through $8$ and $10$ through $20$ and has one blank face. When the two dice are rolled, what is the probability that the sum of the two numbers facing up will be $24?$ Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "If both dice were numbered $1$ through $20,$ we could get a sum of $24$ in the following ways: \\begin{align*}\n4&+20\\\\\n5&+19\\\\\n6&+18\\\\\n& \\ \\, \\vdots \\\\\n18&+6\\\\\n19&+5\\\\\n20&+4\n\\end{align*} This is a total of $20-4+1=17$ ways. However, the first die does not have a face with $20,$ so we must remove the possibility of rolling $20+4.$  Also, the second die does not have a face with $9,$ so we must remove the possibility of rolling $15+9.$ This leaves $17-2=15$ possible ways to roll $24.$ There are a total of $20\\cdot 20=400$ possible rolls, so the final probability is: $$\\frac{15}{400}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{80}}.$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the goal of this problem? What are we trying to find?\n2. How many faces does the first die have? How many faces does the second die have?\n3. Can you determine the number of possible outcomes for rolling each die individually? And what is the total number of possible outcomes when rolling both dice?\n4. What combinations of numbers on the two dice can result in a sum of 24? Explain your reasoning.\n5. Are there any restrictions or limitations for the numbers on each die? If so, how do they affect the possible combinations?\n6. How many valid combinations are there for summing up to 24, considering the restrictions?\n7. What is the probability of getting a sum of 24? Express it as a fraction."
