    "problem": "When two fair 6-sided dice are tossed, the numbers $a$ and $b$ are obtained. What is the probability that the two digit number $ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) and $a$ and $b$ are all divisible by 3?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "$ab$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) is divisible by 3 only when $a+b$ is divisible by 3. Since 3 divides both $a$ and $a+b$, 3 must divide $b$. Therefore, $a$ and $b$ can equal 3 or 6. The probability that $a$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. The probability that $b$ equals 3 or 6 is $\\frac26 = \\frac13$. Therefore, The probability that both $a$ and $b$ equal 3 or 6 is $\\left(\\frac13\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac19}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the possible outcomes when two fair 6-sided dice are tossed?\n2. How can we represent the outcomes of rolling two dice using a table or a chart?\n3. How can we determine if a number is divisible by 3? \n4. How do we apply the concept of divisibility by 3 to the problem of finding the probability that $ab$ is divisible by 3?\n5. Why must 3 divide $b$ in order for $ab$ to be divisible by 3? \n6. What are the possible values of $a$ that would make $a$ and $b$ both divisible by 3? \n7. How can we calculate the probability that $a$ equals 3 or 6, given that we know there are 6 possible outcomes for each die roll?\n8. Using the multiplication principle, how can we calculate the probability that both $a$ and $b$ equal 3 or 6?\n9. Does the probability we have calculated match our intuition about the likelihood of rolling two dice and getting a two-digit number that is divisible by 3? Why or why not?"
