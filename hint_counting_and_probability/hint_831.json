    "problem": "An ancient human tribe had a hierarchical system where there existed one chief with 2 supporting chiefs (supporting chief A and supporting chief B), each of whom had 2 equal, inferior officers. If the tribe at one point had 10 members, what is the number of different ways to choose the leadership of the tribe?  That is, in how many ways can we choose a chief, 2 supporting chiefs, and two inferior officers reporting to each supporting chief?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 10 choices for the chief.  For each choice, there are 9 ways to choose supporting chief A, then 8 ways to choose supporting chief B.  There are then $\\binom{7}{2}$ ways to choose the inferior officers for the supporting chief A and $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose the inferior officers for the supporting chief B.  This gives us a total of $10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot \\binom{7}{2}\\cdot\\binom{5}{2} = \\boxed{151200}$ ways to form the leadership of the tribe.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the different roles within the tribal leadership hierarchy? What is the significance of each role?\n2. How many choices do we have for the chief position? Can you explain why there are 10 choices?\n3. If the chief position is chosen, can you explain how many choices we have for the supporting chief A position? And for supporting chief B position? \n4. How can we calculate the number of ways to choose the inferior officers for supporting chief A? And for supporting chief B?\n5. Can you explain why we use the combination formula $\\binom{n}{r}$ to calculate the number of ways to choose the inferior officers?\n6. What is the meaning of the product $10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot \\binom{7}{2} \\cdot \\binom{5}{2}$ in this context? How does it relate to the number of ways to choose the leadership of the tribe?\n7. Can you think of any other scenarios or problems where the concept of counting and probability can be applied?"
