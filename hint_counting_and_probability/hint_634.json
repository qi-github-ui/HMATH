    "solution": "We can choose the middle color for the flag in 4 ways, then choose the top color in 3 ways, and finally choose the bottom color in 3 ways (the only restriction is that the top and bottom colors are both different from the middle color).  This leads to a total of $4\\cdot 3\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{36}$ possible flags.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the main goal or objective of this problem?\n2. How many total color options are available for each strip of the flag?\n3. If no two adjacent strips can be the same color, how does that affect the available color options for the middle strip?\n4. How many different choices are there for the middle strip color after considering the restrictions?\n5. After choosing the color for the middle strip, how many choices are there for the top strip color?\n6. How many choices are there for the bottom strip color after considering both the restriction and the previously chosen colors?\n7. How do we calculate the total number of possible flags using the choices we calculated for each strip?\n8. Can you explain why we multiply the number of choices for each strip together?\n9. Is there any other way to solve this problem? If so, what would be the alternative approach and how does it compare to the current method?\n10. Are there any other restrictions or conditions that we should consider? How would they impact the total number of possible flags?"
