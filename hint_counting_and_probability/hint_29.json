    "problem": "How many 4-letter words with at least one vowel can be constructed from the letters A, B, C, D, and E?  (Note that A and E are vowels, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First we count the number of all 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word. Then we count the number of 4-letter words with no vowels. We then subtract to get the answer.\n\nEach letter of a word must be one of A, B, C, D, or E, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\\times 5\\times 5\\times 5=625$.  Each letter of a word with no vowel must be one of B, C, or D. So the number of all 4-letter words with no vowels in the word is $3\\times 3\\times 3\\times 3=81$.  Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel is $625-81=\\boxed{544}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. How many letters do we have to choose from in order to construct the words?\n3. How many choices do we have for each position in the 4-letter word?\n4. How can we calculate the total number of 4-letter words with no restrictions?\n5. What are the restrictions for a word to have no vowels?\n6. How many choices do we have for each position in the word with no vowels?\n7. How can we calculate the total number of 4-letter words with no vowels?\n8. How can we find the number of 4-letter words with at least one vowel using the previous calculations?\n9. Can you explain why we subtract the number of words with no vowels from the total number of words to find the answer?\n10. Can you think of any other similar problems where we would need to count possibilities and consider restrictions?"
