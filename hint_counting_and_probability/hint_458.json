    "problem": "How many four-digit positive integers have at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 9000 four-digit positive integers. For those without a 2 or 3, the first digit could be one of the seven numbers 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and each of the other digits could be one of the eight numbers 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So there are \\[\n9000- 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 8\\cdot 8=\\boxed{5416}\n\\] four-digit numbers  with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find?\n2. How many four-digit positive integers are there in total?\n3. For those without a 2 or a 3, how many options do we have for the first digit? What about the other digits?\n4. How can we use this information to find the number of four-digit integers without a 2 or a 3?\n5. How can we find the number of four-digit integers with at least one digit that is a 2 or a 3 using the information we just found?\n6. Can you think of any similar problems involving counting and probability that we could use these same techniques to solve?"
