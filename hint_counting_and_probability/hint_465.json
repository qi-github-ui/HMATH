    "problem": "Two cubes with the faces numbered 1 through 6 are tossed and the numbers shown on the top faces are added. What is the probability that the sum is even? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "After the first cube has been rolled, the other cube has six possible results. Three are one parity, and three are the other parity, so no matter what the first cube shows, there is a $\\boxed{\\frac12}$ chance that the sum is either parity. Note that this is true no matter how many such cubes are rolled.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many different outcomes are possible when tossing two cubes with faces numbered 1 through 6?\n2. What are the possible sums that can be obtained by adding the numbers shown on the top faces of the two cubes?\n3. How many of these possible sums would be considered even numbers?\n4. Can you explain why there are three possible sums that are even and three possible sums that are odd?\n5. If we rolled a single cube, what would be the probability of getting an even number?\n6. How does the answer to the previous question help us determine the probability of getting an even sum when rolling two cubes?\n7. Is the probability of getting an even sum the same as the probability of getting an odd sum? Why or why not?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios or situations where the concept of even and odd numbers can be applied to probability calculations?\n9. How would the probability change if we were tossing three cubes instead of two?"
