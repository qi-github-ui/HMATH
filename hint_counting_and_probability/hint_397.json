    "solution": "Color the dots red and blue as shown below. Notice that whenever the ant moves, it moves from a red dot to a blue dot or a blue dot to a red dot. So since $A$ is a red dot, it must move to a blue dot, then a red dot, then a blue dot, then a red dot, and end up on a blue dot. There are only four blue dots, and the ant is equally likely to end up on any one of these four, since the diagram is symmetric to a $90^\\circ$ rotation. The probability that the ant ends on $B$ after five minutes is therefore $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.

    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. What does it mean for the ant to move randomly to one of its neighboring dots? How does that affect the probability?\n3. What is the relationship between the red and blue dots? How does it impact the ant's movement?\n4. How many blue dots are there in total? Why is the number of blue dots relevant?\n5. Is there any pattern or symmetry that we can observe in the lattice?\n6. Why is the lattice symmetric to a 90-degree rotation? How does this symmetry affect the ant's final position?"
