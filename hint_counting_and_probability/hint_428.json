    "problem": "In Morse code, each symbol is represented by a sequence of dashes and dots. How many distinct symbols can be represented using sequences of 1, 2, 3, or 4 total dots and/or dashes?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We proceed by casework.\n\nCase I: 1 dot or dash\nThere are two possibilities: one dot, or one dash.\n\nCase II: 2 dots or dashes\nEach symbol can be a dot or a dash, so there are $2 \\cdot 2 = 4$ sequences in this case.\n\nCase III: 3 dots or dashes\nEach symbol can be a dot or a dash, so there are $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8$ sequences in this case.\n\nCase IV: 4 dots or dashes\nEach symbol can be a dot or a dash, so there are $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 16$ sequences in this case.\n\nThus, there are $2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = \\boxed{30}$ distinct symbols that can be formed.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is Morse code, and how is each symbol represented in it?\n2. How many cases are needed to count the total distinct symbols that can be represented using 1 to 4 total dots and/or dashes?\n3. In Case I, what are the two possibilities for a single dot or dash? \n4. In Case II, how many distinct sequences can be formed using 2 dots or dashes?\n5. How many sequences can be formed using 3 dots or dashes in Case III, and what is the reasoning behind this number?\n6. In Case IV, why are there 16 distinct sequences that can be formed using 4 dots or dashes?\n7. How can we use the results obtained from each case to find the total number of distinct symbols that can be represented by Morse code?"
