    "problem": "The set $S = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots , 49, 50\\}$ contains the first $50$ positive integers.  After the multiples of 2 and the multiples of 3 are removed, how many integers remain in the set $S$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The set $S$ contains $25$ multiples of 2 (that is, even numbers).  When these are removed, the set $S$ is left with only the odd integers from 1 to 49. At this point, there are $50-25=25$ integers in $S$. We still need to remove the multiples of 3 from $S$.\n\nSince $S$ only contains odd integers after the multiples of 2 are removed,  we must remove the odd multiples of 3 between 1 and 49.  These are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, of which there are 8.  Therefore, the number of integers remaining in the set $S$ is $25 - 8 = \\boxed{17}$.",

How many multiples of 3 are there in set S?\n6. What happens to the size of set S after the multiples of 3 are removed?\n7. What is the final number of integers remaining in set S after both the multiples of 2 and the multiples of 3 are removed?"
