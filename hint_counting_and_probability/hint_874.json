    "problem": "How many distinct sequences of four letters can be made from the letters in PROBLEM if each letter can be used only once and each sequence must begin with L and not end with P?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The first letter, as stated, must be L, and the fourth letter cannot be P. One way to solve this is to consider the permutations of all 7 letters where the first four satisfy these conditions, and then divide to correct for overcounting. Once we have placed the L, we have 5 options for where to place the P--- any spot except the fourth one, which will become the last one when we remove the last three letters. We can then place the remaining 5 letters without restriction, which there are $5!$ ways to do. This gives us a preliminary count of $5\\times5!=600$. However, no matter what the order of the last three letters, we will still get the same sequence of the first 4 letters; for example, LPROMEB, LPROEBM, and LPROBEM and three other permutations all have the first 4 letters LPRO. Because of this, each sequence of 4 letters has been counted exactly 6 times so our answer is $\\dfrac{5\\times5!}{6}=\\boxed{100}$.\n\nAlternative solution by stevenmeow: There are 5 ways to choose the last letter (B, R, O, M, or E) and the L must go first.  That leaves 5 letters from which to choose the second and third letters, so we can choose the second and third letters in $5\\times 4 = 20$ ways.  This gives us a total of $5\\times 20 = 100$ sequences of letters.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the conditions for creating a distinct sequence of four letters from PROBLEM as outlined in the problem statement?\n2. Can you explain the reasoning behind dividing the preliminary count of possible sequences by 6? Why do we need to correct for overcounting?\n3. Are there any other possible methods to approach this problem? What are their advantages and disadvantages?\n4. What is the relationship between counting and probability? How can we use probability to approach problems similar to this one?\n5. Can we generalize this problem to sequences of more or fewer letters? If so, how would that change our approach to solving it?"
