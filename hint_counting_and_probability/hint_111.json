    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Let us consider the number of three-digit integers that do not contain $3$ and $5$ as digits; let this set be $S$. For any such number, there would be $7$ possible choices for the hundreds digit (excluding $0,3$, and $5$), and $8$ possible choices for each of the tens and ones digits. Thus, there are $7 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = 448$ three-digit integers without a $3$ or $5$.\n\nNow, we count the number of three-digit integers that just do not contain a $5$ as a digit; let this set be $T$. There would be $8$ possible choices for the hundreds digit, and $9$ for each of the others, giving $8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 9 = 648$. By the complementary principle, the set of three-digit integers with at least one $3$ and no $5$s is the number of integers in $T$ but not $S$. There are $648 - 448 = \\boxed{200}$ such numbers.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the set of three-digit integers that do not contain the digits 3 and 5?\n2. How many possible choices are there for the hundreds digit in a three-digit integer without the digits 3 and 5?\n3. What are the possible choices for the tens and ones digits in a three-digit integer without the digits 3 and 5?\n4. How can we calculate the number of three-digit integers without a 3 or 5 using the choices for the hundreds, tens, and ones digits?\n5. What is the count of three-digit integers without a 3 or 5?\n6. Now let's consider the set of three-digit integers that just do not contain a 5 as a digit. Let's call this set T. What are the possible choices for the hundreds, tens, and ones digits in this set?\n7. How can we calculate the number of three-digit integers without a 5 using the choices for the hundreds, tens, and ones digits in set T?\n8. What is the count of three-digit integers without a 5?\n9. According to the complementary principle, how can we find the count of three-digit integers with at least one 3 and no 5s?\n10. What is the count of three-digit integers with at least one 3 and no 5s?"
