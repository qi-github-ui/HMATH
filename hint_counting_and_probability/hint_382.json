    "problem": "The chart below gives the air distance in miles between selected world cities. If two different cities from the chart are chosen at random, what is the probability that the distance between them is less than $7000$ miles? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n& Bangkok & Cape Town & Honolulu & London \\\\ \\hline\nBangkok & & 6300 & 6609 & 5944 \\\\ \\hline\nCape Town & 6300 & & 11,535 & 5989 \\\\ \\hline\nHonolulu & 6609 & 11,535 & & 7240 \\\\ \\hline\nLondon & 5944 & 5989 & 7240 & \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}",

    "solution": "Although there are 12 entries on the table, there are only 6 different ``pairs'' of cities. Of the 6 pairs, 4 of them are less than 7,000 miles apart, yielding a $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$ probability that you select a pair less than 7,000 miles apart.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given chart describing? \n2. How many entries are there on the chart and how many unique pairs of cities can be formed from the entries? \n3. What does it mean for the distance between two cities to be less than 7000 miles? \n4. How many pairs of cities on the chart have distances less than 7000 miles? \n5. How do we calculate the probability of selecting two cities with a distance less than 7000 miles from the 6 possible pairs? \n6. What is the final answer to the problem and how is it expressed as a common fraction? \n7. Can you think of any other ways in which probability can be calculated using distance measurements on a chart like this one?"
