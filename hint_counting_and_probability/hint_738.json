    "problem": "Our football team has 10 members, of which only 3 are strong enough to play offensive lineman, while all other positions can be played by anyone. In how many ways can we choose a starting lineup consisting of a quarterback, a running back, an offensive lineman, and a wide receiver?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 3 choices for the offensive lineman position. Then there are 9 choices for the next position, 8 choices for the  position after, and 7 choices for the last position. So that's a total of $3\\times9\\times8\\times7 = \\boxed{1512}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given problem asking us to find?\n2. How many members are there on the football team in total?\n3. How many members are eligible to play offensive lineman?\n4. Are there any limitations on the other positions that can be played?\n5. Can you explain the concept of permutations and combinations in regards to this problem?\n6. How did you determine the number of choices for each position?\n7. Can you explain why we multiply the number of choices for each position to get the total number of starting lineups?\n8. Are there any other methods or formulas that can be used to solve this problem?\n9. Can you provide an example of a similar problem that involves permutations or combinations?\n10. How can understanding permutations and combinations be useful in real-life situations?"
