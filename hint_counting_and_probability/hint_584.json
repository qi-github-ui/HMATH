    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "To make the arithmetic a little easier, we can write out 7! as $7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 7 \\times 5 \\times 3^2 \\times 2^4$. And, $5 \\times 8 \\times 2 = 5 \\times 2^4$. So, $n = \\frac{7 \\times 5 \\times 3^2 \\times 2^4}{5 \\times 2^4} = 7 \\times 3^2 = \\boxed{63}$.",

How can we simplify the expression, $5 \\times 8 \\times 2 \\times n$, using the prime factorization of 7!?\n4. What are the common factors in $5 \\times 8 \\times 2 \\times n$ and $7!$ that can be canceled out?\n5. What is the simplified expression for $\\frac{7 \\times 5 \\times 3^2 \\times 2^4}{5 \\times 2^4}$?\n6. Can you explain how you arrived at the value of n = 63?"
