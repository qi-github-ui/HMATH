    "problem": "The three-digit positive integer $N$ has a ones digit of 3. What is the probability that $N$ is divisible by 3? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Let $N = xy3$, where $x,y$ are digits.  Then $N$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the number $xy$ is.  But since $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the two-digit integers are divisible by 3, our final probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the problem is asking us to find?\n2. How can we represent the three-digit number $N$ with the digits $x$, $y$, and 3?\n3. In order for a number to be divisible by 3, what property or properties must the digits of the number have?\n4. Can you think of any examples of two-digit numbers that are divisible by 3? How would this knowledge help us in solving this problem?\n5. How many two-digit numbers are there in total? And how many of those are divisible by 3?\n6. How can we express the probability of a randomly chosen two-digit number being divisible by 3?\n7. How does the probability we found in the previous question relate to the probability of $N$ being divisible by 3?\n8. Does our final answer of $\\frac{1}{3}$ make sense in the context of the problem? Why or why not?\n9. Can you think of any other scenarios or problems where similar logic or steps might be used to determine the probability of a certain event happening?"
