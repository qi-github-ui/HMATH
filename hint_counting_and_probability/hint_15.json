    "problem": "What is the probability of rolling six standard, six-sided dice and getting six distinct numbers? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "There are $6^6$ different possible rolls exhibited by the six dice. If the six dice yield distinct numbers, then there are $6$ possible values that can appear on the first die, $5$ that can appear on the second die, and so forth. Thus, there are $6!$ ways to attain $6$ distinct numbers on the die. The desired probability is $\\frac{6!}{6^6} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{20}{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{5}{2^2 \\cdot 3^4} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{324}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the possible outcomes when rolling six standard, six-sided dice?\n2. How many different possible rolls can be exhibited by the six dice?\n3. If the six dice yield distinct numbers, how many possible values can appear on the first die?\n4. How many possible values can appear on the second die if the first die has already yielded one distinct number?\n5. Continuing from question 4, how many possible values can appear on the third die if the first two dice have yielded distinct numbers?\n6. What is the formula to calculate the number of ways to attain a certain arrangement of distinct numbers on the six dice?\n7. Can you calculate the numerator of the probability expression using the formula mentioned in question 6?\n8. Can you calculate the denominator of the probability expression using the number of possible rolls mentioned in question 2?\n9. What is the simplified fraction expression for the probability of rolling six distinct numbers on the dice?"
