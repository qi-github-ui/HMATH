    "problem": "Ten standard 6-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that exactly one of the dice shows a 1?  Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest thousandth.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{10}{1}$ ways to roll exactly one 1 out of 10 dice. The probability of any one of these occurring is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^{\\!1}\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{\\!9}$.  So the overall probability is \\[ \\binom{10}{1}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{6}\\bigg)^{\\!1}\\bigg(\\frac{5}{6}\\bigg)^{\\!9}=\\frac{10\\times 5^9}{6^{10}} \\approx \\boxed{0.323}. \\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the question asking for in this problem?\n2. How many dice are being rolled in total?\n3. What does it mean for \"exactly one of the dice to show a 1\"?\n4. How many ways can we choose exactly one dice to show a 1 out of the 10 dice? \n5. How likely is it for each individual chosen dice to show a 1?\n6. How likely is it for the remaining 9 dice to not show a 1?\n7. How do we calculate the probability of a specific combination occurring?\n8. How can we use the combination formula to calculate the number of ways?\n9. How can we use the probability of each individual event occurring to calculate the overall probability? \n10. Can you compute the final probability by plugging in the values into the formulas?"
