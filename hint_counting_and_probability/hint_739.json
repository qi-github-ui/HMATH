    "problem": "Cybil and Ronda are sisters. The 10 letters from their names are placed on identical cards so that each of 10 cards contains one letter. Without replacement, two cards are selected at random from the 10 cards. What is the probability that one letter is from each sister's name? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "The probability that the first letter selected will be from Cybil's name, and the second from Ronda's name, will be $\\frac{5}{10}\\cdot \\frac{5}{9}=\\frac{5}{18}$.  Similarly, the probability that the first letter will be from Ronda's name, and the second from Cybil's name, is also $\\frac{5}{10}\\cdot \\frac{5}{9}=\\frac{5}{18}$.  The probability that one letter will be selected from each name is then $\\frac{5}{18}+\\frac{5}{18}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{9}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many letters are in Cybil's name and Ronda's name?\n2. How many cards are there in total?\n3. If we want to select two cards without replacement, how many outcomes are possible?\n4. What does it mean for one letter to be from each sister's name?\n5. How many ways can we select one letter from Cybil's name and one letter from Ronda's name?\n6. Can you write out all the possible outcomes of selecting two cards?\n7. What is the probability of selecting one letter from each sister's name?\n8. Can you simplify the probability expression we obtained earlier?\n9. What does the simplified expression tell us about the probability?\n10. Can you think of any other scenarios where similar counting and probability concepts apply?"
