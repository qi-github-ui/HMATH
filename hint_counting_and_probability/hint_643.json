    "problem": "Bicycle license plates in Flatville each contain three letters. The first is chosen from the set $\\{C,H,L,P,R\\},$ the second from $\\{A,I,O\\},$ and the third from $\\{D,M,N,T\\}.$\n\nWhen Flatville needed more license plates, they added two new letters. The new letters may both be added to one set or one letter may be added to one set and one to another set. What is the largest possible number of ADDITIONAL license plates that can be made by adding two letters?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Before new letters were added, five different letters could have been chosen for the first position, three for the second, and four for the third. This means that $5\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=60$ plates could have been made.\n\nIf two letters are added to the second set, then $5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4=100$ plates can be made. If one letter is added to each of the second and third sets, then $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 5=100$ plates can be made. None of the other four ways to place the two letters will create as many plates. So, $100-60=\\boxed{40}$ ADDITIONAL plates can be made.\n\nNote: Optimum results can usually be obtained in such problems by making the factors as nearly equal as possible.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information and what is the problem asking us to find?\n2. How many letters are there in total before any new letters are added?\n3. How many different choices do we have for each position before any new letters are added?\n4. What is the total number of license plates that can be made before any new letters are added?\n5. If both new letters are added to the second set, how many additional license plates can be made?\n6. If one new letter is added to the second set and one new letter is added to the third set, how many additional license plates can be made?\n7. Are there any other ways to add the two new letters that could potentially create more additional license plates?\n8. How can we calculate the number of additional license plates made in each scenario?\n9. Which scenario results in the largest number of additional license plates?\n10. How can we find the largest possible number of additional license plates in this problem?"
