    "problem": "If the probability that a baby born in a certain hospital will speak in the next day is 1/4, what is the probability that at least 2 babies out of a cluster of 5 babies will speak tomorrow?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We will use complementary probability: we will find the probability that no more than 1 baby speaks tomorrow, and then subtract the result from 1. There are two cases to consider: None of the babies will speak and that exactly 1 will speak.\n\n1) The probability that none of the babies will speak tomorrow is $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{5} = 243/1024$.\n\n2) The probability that exactly 1 will speak is $\\binom{5}{1}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{405}{1024}$.\n\nThe sum of these probabilities is $\\frac{243 + 405}{1024} = \\frac{648}{1024} = \\frac{81}{128}$.  Since the probability that no more than 1 baby will speak is $\\frac{81}{128}$, the probability that more than 1 baby will speak is $1 - \\frac{81}{128} = \\boxed{\\frac{47}{128}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define the concept of probability in this problem?\n2. What does it mean for a baby to \"speak\" in this context?\n3. Can you explain why the probability of a baby speaking is given as 1/4?\n4. How many babies are we considering in this problem?\n5. How can we determine the probability that no more than 1 baby speaks out of the cluster of 5 babies?\n6. Why do we need to find the complementary probability in this case?\n7. Can you explain how we calculate the probability that none of the babies will speak?\n8. How do we calculate the probability that exactly 1 baby will speak?\n9. How do we combine these probabilities to find the final answer?\n10. Can you summarize the steps we took to find the probability that at least 2 babies speak?"
