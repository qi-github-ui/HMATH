    "problem": "Ben rolls four fair 20-sided dice, and each of the dice has faces numbered from 1 to 20. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 20-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^4=\\frac{1}{16}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $6\\cdot \\frac{1}{16}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the concept of probability? \n2. How many sides does each of the 20-sided dice have? \n3. What is the probability of a 20-sided die showing an even number? And what about showing an odd number? \n4. How many dice does Ben roll? \n5. How can we calculate the probability of getting exactly two dice showing even numbers? \n6. How many ways can we choose which two dice show even numbers out of the four? \n7. What is the probability of one specific arrangement of two even and two odd rolls happening? \n8. How can we calculate the overall probability of all six possible arrangements occurring? \n9. Using the answers from the previous questions, can you calculate the probability of exactly two dice showing even numbers? \n10. Can you think of any similar problems where we can apply the same concepts of probability and counting?"
