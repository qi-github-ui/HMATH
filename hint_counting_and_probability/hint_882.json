    "problem": "Let $A$ equal the number of four digit odd numbers.  Let $B$ equal the number of four digit multiples of 5.  Find $A+B$.",

    "solution": "For an odd number, there are 5 choices for the units digit, coming from the set $\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$.  There will be 10 choices for the tens digit, 10 choices for the hundreds digit, and 9 choices for the thousands digit, which can not be zero.  This is a total of: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times5=4500\\text{ four digit odd numbers}$$Multiples of 5 must end in 0 or 5.  So, there are two possibilities for the units digit, and the same number of possibilities for remaining digits.  This gives: $$9\\times10\\times10\\times2=1800\\text{ four digit multiples of 5}$$Therefore, $A+B=4500+1800=\\boxed{6300}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain why we are considering four-digit numbers? What is the significance of this restriction?\n2. How did we determine that there are 5 choices for the units digit of an odd number? Can you provide some examples to support this reasoning?\n3. Why do we have 10 choices for the tens digit? Can you explain the rationale behind this?\n4. Can you describe the reasoning behind having 10 choices for the hundreds digit as well? What does this tell us about the structure of four-digit numbers?\n5. Why do we have 9 choices for the thousands digit? What would happen if we allowed zero as a choice for this digit?\n6. How did we calculate that there are 4500 four-digit odd numbers? Can we verify this result using a different approach?\n7. Let's shift our focus to the multiples of 5. Why must their units digit be either 0 or 5? Can you provide a logical explanation for this characteristic?\n8. What is the significance of having two possibilities for the units digit of multiples of 5? How does this affect the overall count of four-digit multiples of 5?\n9. Why do we still have 10 choices for the tens and hundreds digits of multiples of 5? Can you explain the reasoning behind this?\n10. How did we determine that there are 1800 four-digit multiples of 5? Is there another method to count them that leads to the same result?\n11. By adding the counts of four-digit odd numbers and four-digit multiples of 5, we obtain the value of A+B. Can you explain the reasoning behind this addition?\n12. Finally, what is the value of A+B? How does this total help us understand the relationship between odd numbers and multiples of 5?"
