    "problem": "Each of five, standard, six-sided dice is rolled once. What is the probability that there is at least one pair but not a three-of-a-kind (that is, there are two dice showing the same value, but no three dice show the same value)?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are a total of $6^5=7776$ possible sets of dice rolls. To get a pair without a three-of-a-kind, we can either have one pair and the other three dice all showing different numbers, or we have two pairs and the fifth die showing something different.\n\nIn the first case, there are $6$ ways to pick which number makes a pair and $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to pick which $2$ of the $5$ dice show that number. Out of the other three dice, there are $5$ ways to pick a value for the first die so that that die doesn't match the pair, $4$ ways to pick a value for the second one so it doesn't match that die or the pair, and $3$ ways to pick a value for the last die so that it doesn't match any of the others. So there are $$6\\cdot 10\\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 6^2 \\cdot 100$$ways to roll this case.\n\nIn the second case, to form two pairs and one die not part of those pairs, there are $\\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways to pick which two numbers make the pairs, then $4$ ways to pick a value for the last die so that it doesn't match either of those pairs. There are $$\\frac{5!}{2!\\cdot 2!\\cdot 1!}=30$$ways order the five dice (equal to the number of ways to order XXYYZ),  so that makes a total of $$15\\cdot 4 \\cdot 30 = 6^2\\cdot 50$$ways to roll this case.\n\nThis makes a total of $$6^2 \\cdot 100 + 6^2 \\cdot 50 = 6^2 \\cdot 150 = 6^3 \\cdot 25$$ways to roll a pair without rolling a three-of-a-kind. So, the probability is $$\\frac{\\text{successful outcomes}}{\\text{total outcomes}}=\\frac{6^3 \\cdot 25}{6^5}=\\frac{25}{6^2}=\\boxed{\\frac{25}{36}}.$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five standard, six-sided dice?\n2. In order to have at least one pair but not a three-of-a-kind, what are the possible scenarios?\n3. Let's analyze the first scenario: having one pair and the other three dice all showing different numbers. How many ways can we pick the number for the pair and the specific dice that show that number?\n4. Out of the other three dice, how many ways can we select values so that none of them match each other or the pair?\n5. How many total outcomes are there for this first scenario?\n6. Now, let's examine the second scenario: having two pairs and the fifth die showing a different value. How many ways can we choose the two numbers that form the pairs?\n7. How many ways can we pick a value for the fifth die so that it doesn't match any of the pairs?\n8. Considering the number of ways to arrange the five dice, how many total outcomes are there for this second scenario?\n9. What is the sum of the outcomes from both scenarios?\n10. What is the probability of rolling a pair without rolling a three-of-a-kind?"
