What is the probability that the product of Manu's number and Paco's number is less than 30? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "A little casework seems like the simplest approach. First, if Paco spins a 1 or 2, it does not matter what Manu spins; the product is less than 30 regardless. If Paco spins a 3, the product will be 30 or greater only if Manu spins a 10, and both of these will be true with probability $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{50}$. If Paco spins a 4, Manu's spins of 8, 9 or 10 will tip us over the 30 barrier, and this with probability $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{3}{50}$. If Paco spins a 5, Manu will break the 30 threshold with a 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10, probabilities being $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{10}$. The total probability for these three cases is $\\frac{1+3+5}{50} = \\frac{9}{50}$. But, we want the probability that the product is less than 30, so we subtract our fraction from 1 and get $\\boxed{\\frac{41}{50}}$.",

How can we calculate the probability of Paco spinning each number?\n4. How can we calculate the probability of Manu spinning each number?\n5. How can we find the product of Paco's number and Manu's number?\n6. How do we determine if the product is less than 30?\n7. Can we break down the problem into different cases based on Paco's number?\n8. For each case, what numbers would lead to the product being less than 30?\n9. What is the probability of each case occurring?\n10. Can we add up these probabilities to find the total probability?\n11. If the total probability is not what we want, how can we adjust it to find the probability that the product is less than 30?\n12. What is the final probability?"
