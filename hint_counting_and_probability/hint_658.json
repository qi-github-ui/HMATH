    "problem": "Let $ S $ be the set of all sides and diagonals of a regular pentagon. A pair of elements of $ S $ are selected at random without replacement. What is the probability that the two chosen segments have the same length?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "In a regular pentagon, there are $5$ sides of the same length and $5$ diagonals of the same length. Picking an element at random will leave 4 elements with the same length as the element picked, with $9$ total elements remaining. Therefore, the probability that the second element has the same length as the first is simply $\\boxed{\\tfrac{4}{9}}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what \"probability\" means in the context of this problem?\n2. How many sides and diagonals are there in a regular pentagon? Are they all of the same length?\n3. If we select one segment at random, how many segments of the same length are left in the set?\n4. How many total segments are left in the set after the first segment is chosen? How many of them have the same length as the first segment?\n5. How can we determine the probability that the second segment has the same length as the first segment?\n6. Can you calculate the probability of selecting two segments with the same length using the information we have discussed?"
