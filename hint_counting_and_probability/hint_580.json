    "problem": "Four red candies and three green candies can be combined to make many different flavors. Flavors are different if the percent red is different, so 3 red / 0 green is the same flavor as 2 red / 0 green; and likewise 4 red / 2 green is the same flavor as 2 red / 1 green. If a flavor is to be made using some or all of the seven candies, how many different flavors are possible?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Denote the ratio by $x:y$, where $x$ is the number of red candies and $y$ is the number of green. We can have $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, or $4$ red candies and $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$ green candies. Thus, there are $5 \\cdot 4 = 20$ potential ratios. However, a $0:0$ ratio is not allowed (there would be no candy!), so we subtract one for a total of $19$ ratios possible. Now we must subtract the ratios we've over-counted. In particular, $0:1$ is the same as $0:2$ and $0:3$, and $1:0$ is the same as $2:0$, $3:0$, and $4:0$. Also, $1:1$ is the same as $2:2$ and $3:3$, and $2:1$ is the same as $4:2$. Thus, we have over-counted by $8$ ratios, so our final answer is $19 - 8 = \\boxed{11}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of a \"flavor\" in this context?\n2. How can we represent the number of red candies and green candies in a flavor? What notation can we use?\n3. How many different combinations of red and green candies can we have?\n4. Can we have zero red candies in a flavor? How about zero green candies? Why or why not?\n5. How many total potential ratios can we have between red and green candies?\n6. Are there any specific ratios that are not allowed? Why?\n7. How can we account for the over-counted ratios? Which ratios are considered duplicates?\n8. By subtracting the duplicates, how many unique ratios or flavors are left?"
