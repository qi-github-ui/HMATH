    "problem": "If I roll a fair, regular six-sided die four times, what is the probability that I will roll the number $1$ exactly three times?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Each roll is independent of every other roll, so the probability of getting a $1$ on any given roll is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability of not getting a $1$ on any given roll is $\\frac{5}{6}$. Since we are looking for a $1$ rolled three times and a number not $1$ rolled once, we have $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}$. Now, we have to consider the order of the rolls. The number that is not a $1$ could be rolled on the first, second, third, or fourth roll, so we multiply by four. Hence, the probability of rolling $1$ exactly three times is $4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{324}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for each roll to be independent?\n2. What is the probability of rolling a 1 on any given roll? And of not rolling a 1?\n3. How can we calculate the probability of rolling a 1 exactly three times and another number not being a 1 rolled once?\n4. Why do we need to multiply the probability of getting a 1 three times with the probability of not getting a 1 once?\n5. What is the order of the rolls? How does it affect the calculation?\n6. How many different orders are there for rolling a 1 three times and another number not being a 1 rolled once?\n7. How can we use the concept of permutations to account for the different order possibilities?\n8. Can you calculate the final probability using the information we discussed?\n9. In what other situations might you apply similar thinking and steps to calculate probabilities?"
