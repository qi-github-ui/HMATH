    "problem": "If three people are selected at random from a group of seven men and three women, what is the probability that at least one woman is selected? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We can find the probability that no women are selected and subtract it from 1 to find the probability that at least one woman is selected. To find the probability that only men are selected, we consider that the chance that the first person selected is male is $\\frac{7}{10}$. Then the probability that the second person selected is male is reduced to $\\frac{6}{9}=\\frac{2}{3}$. For the third person, the probability is $\\frac{5}{8}$. So the probability that only men are selected is $$\\frac{7}{10}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{5}{8}=\\frac{7}{24}.$$ Notice that the 2 and 5 in the numerator cancel with the 10 in the denominator to leave $\\frac{7}{24}$. Now we subtract from 1 to find the probability that at least one woman is selected. The probability is $1-\\frac{7}{24}=\\boxed{\\frac{17}{24}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step in finding the probability of at least one woman being selected from the group?\n2. Can you explain how the probability of only men being selected is calculated? \n3. Why do we need to find the probability of only men being selected in order to find the probability of at least one woman being selected?\n4. How do we calculate the probability of only men being selected?\n5. Can you explain why we subtract the probability of only men being selected from 1 to find the probability of at least one woman being selected?\n6. What is the final probability of at least one woman being selected? How is this fraction calculated?\n7. Can you think of any other situations where finding the probability of at least one event occurring would involve a similar thought process and steps?"
