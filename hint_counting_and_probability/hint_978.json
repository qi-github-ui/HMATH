    "problem": "A point $P$ is randomly selected from the rectangular region with vertices $(0,0), (2,0)$, $(2,1),(0,1)$. What is the probability that $P$ is closer to the origin than it is to the point $(3,1)$?",

    "solution": "The area of the rectangular region is 2. Hence the probability that $P$ is closer to $(0,0)$ than it is to $(3,1)$ is half the area of the trapezoid bounded by the lines $y=1$, the $x$- and $y$-axes, and the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining $(0,0)$ and $(3,1)$. The perpendicular bisector goes through the point $(3/2,1/2)$, which is the center of the square whose vertices are $(1,0), (2,0), (2,1), \\text{ and\n}(1,1)$. Hence, the line cuts the square  into two quadrilaterals of equal  area $1/2$. Thus the area of the trapezoid is $3/2$ and the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((-1,0)--(4,0),Arrow);\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,3),Arrow);\nfor (int i=0; i<4; ++i) {\ndraw((i,-0.2)--(i,0.2));\n}\nfor (int i=0; i<3; ++i) {\ndraw((-0.2,i)--(0.2,i));\n}\nlabel(\"$x$\",(3.7,0),S);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,2.7),W);\nlabel(\"1\",(1,-0.2),S);\nlabel(\"2\",(2,-0.2),S);\nlabel(\"3\",(3,-0.2),S);\nlabel(\"1\",(-0.2,1),W);\nlabel(\"2\",(-0.2,2),W);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((1,2)--(2,-1),linewidth(0.7));\ndot((1.5,0.5));\ndot((3,1));\ndraw((1,0)--(1,1.3),dashed);\ndraw((1.5,0.5)--(1.7,1.5));\nlabel(\"($\\frac{3}{2}$,$\\frac{1}{2}$)\",(1.7,1.5),N);\ndraw((0,1)--(2,1)--(2,0),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$(3,1)$\",(3,1),N);\n[/asy]",
