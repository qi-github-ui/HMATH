    "problem": "How many different positive, five-digit integers can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 2, 9 and 9?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 5 distinct digits, there would be $5! = 120$ orderings. However, we must divide by 3! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digits were different then we could rearrange them in that many ways).  So, our answer is $\\frac{5!}{3!\\cdot 2!} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2} = \\boxed{10}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking for? \n2. How many digits are there to choose from when forming five-digit integers? \n3. What is overcounting and why do we need to correct for it in this problem? \n4. How many total orderings are there if all five digits were distinct? \n5. Why do we divide by 3! and 2! when correcting for overcounting? \n6. How would the answer change if there were three 2s and two 9s instead?"
