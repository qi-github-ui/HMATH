    "problem": "In how many distinct ways can I arrange my five keys on a keychain, if I want to put my house key next to my car key? Two arrangements are not considered different if the keys are in the same order (or can be made to be in the same order without taking the keys off the chain--that is, by reflection or rotation).",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First, put the house key and car key next to each other on the keychain. It doesn't matter where they are put, because the keychain can be rotated and reflected to move them to any other pair of adjacent locations. The remaining three keys can be put on the keychain in $3!=\\boxed{6}$ ways.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of keys you have on your keychain?\n2. How many different ways can you arrange the five keys on the keychain without any restrictions?\n3. How many ways can you arrange the remaining three keys when the house key and car key are already together?\n4. Can you explain why the number of arrangements would be affected by rotation or reflection?\n5. If the house key and car key are arranged differently, how would it affect the total number of arrangements?\n6. Can you generalize this problem to a keychain with a different number of keys?\n7. Are there any other restrictions or conditions that could affect the number of arrangements?"
