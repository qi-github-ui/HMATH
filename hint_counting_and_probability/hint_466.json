    "problem": "A Senate committee has 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans.  In how many ways can they sit around a circular table if each member sits next to two members of the other party? (Two seatings are the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The only way that the Senators can be seated is if the seats alternate by party.  Fix the rotation by placing the youngest Democrat in the top seat, so that we have removed the overcounting of rotations of the same arrangement.  Now there are $4!$ ways to place the remaining Democrats in the other Democratic seats, and $5!$ ways to place the Republicans in the Republican seats, for a total of $5! \\times 4! = \\boxed{2,\\!880}$ arrangements.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the setup of the problem? Can you describe the seating arrangement of the Senate committee?\n2. How many Democrats and Republicans are there in the Senate committee?\n3. What does it mean for each member to sit next to two members of the other party? Can you provide an example of a valid seating arrangement?\n4. How many ways can the senators be seated around a circular table without any restrictions?\n5. Why is it necessary to fix the rotation by placing the youngest Democrat in the top seat?\n6. How many ways are there to place the remaining Democrats in the other Democratic seats after fixing the rotation?\n7. How many ways are there to place the Republicans in the Republican seats?\n8. What is the total number of valid seating arrangements when considering both the Democrats and Republicans?\n9. Can you explain why we multiply the number of ways to place Democrats and Republicans to obtain the total arrangements?\n10. What is the final answer to the problem?"
