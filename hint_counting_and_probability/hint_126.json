    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{7}{2} = 21$ ways in which Mary and James can choose 2 chairs, if we don't worry about the order in which they sit. Although we can use casework to count the number of ways they can choose chairs which are not next to each other, it is easier to use complementary counting.  If we number the chairs $\\#1, \\#2, \\ldots, \\#7$ in order, then there are 6 ways Mary and James can choose chairs next to each other: they can sit in the first two chairs, or chairs $\\#2$ and $\\#3,$ or chairs $\\#3$ and $\\#4,$ etc., up to chairs $\\#6$ and $\\#7.$  Therefore $ P(\\text{they sit next to each other}) = \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7}, $ and therefore $ P(\\text{they don't sit next to each other}) = 1-\\frac{2}{7} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}. $",

What would be the probability if Mary and James were to sit next to each other?\n4. How can we determine the number of ways they can sit next to each other?\n5. Can you explain the concept of complementary counting and how it can be applied in this problem?\n6. How can we find the total number of ways they can sit apart using complementary counting?\n7. Can you calculate the probability of Mary and James not sitting next to each other?\n8. Can you explain the steps involved in calculating the probability of them sitting apart?"
