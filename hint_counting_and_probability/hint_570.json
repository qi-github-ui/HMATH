    "problem": "If Greg rolls four fair six-sided dice, what is the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We notice that the probability that he rolls more 1's than 6's must equal the probability that he rolls more 6's than 1's. So, we can find the probability that Greg rolls the same number of 1's and 6's, subtract it from 1, and divide by 2 to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's. There are three ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's: he can roll two of each, one of each, or none of each. If he rolls two of each, there are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose which two dice roll the 1's. If he rolls one of each, there are $\\binom{4}{1}\\binom{3}{1}=12$ ways to choose which dice are the 6 and the 1, and for each of those ways there are $4\\cdot4=16$ ways to choose the values of the other dice. If Greg rolls no 1's or 6's, there are $4^4=256$ possible values for the dice. In total, there are $6+12\\cdot16+256=454$ ways Greg can roll the same number of 1's and 6's. There are $6^4=1296$ total ways the four dice can roll, so the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's is $\\dfrac{1}{2} \\left(1-\\dfrac{454}{1296}\\right)=\\boxed{\\dfrac{421}{1296}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of probability?\n2. How many sides does each die have?\n3. What are the possible outcomes when rolling one die?\n4. What is the total number of outcomes when rolling four dice?\n5. How many ways are there for Greg to roll more 1's than 6's?\n6. How many ways are there for Greg to roll more 6's than 1's?\n7. Why is the probability of rolling more 1's than 6's the same as the probability of rolling more 6's than 1's?\n8. How can we find the probability of Greg rolling the same number of 1's and 6's?\n9. How many ways are there for Greg to roll two 1's and two 6's?\n10. How many ways are there for Greg to roll one 1 and one 6, and what are the possible values of the other two dice?\n11. How many ways are there for Greg to roll no 1's or 6's?\n12. What is the total number of ways for Greg to roll the same number of 1's and 6's?\n13. How can we use the above information to find the probability that Greg rolls more 1's than 6's?\n14. Can you think of any other situations where we might need to find the probability of one event occurring more than another event?"
