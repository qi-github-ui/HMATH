    "solution": "Let $h$ be the distance from $P$ to $CB$.  The area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(AC)(CB)$.  The area of triangle $PBC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(h)(CB)$.  Therefore, the area of triangle $PBC$ is less than one-half of the area of triangle $ABC$ if $h<AC/2$.  This happens if $P$ falls below the dashed line whose endpoints are the midpoints $D$ and $E$ of $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{AB}$.  Triangle $ADE$ is similar to triangle $ACB$, so the ratio of the area of triangle $ADE$ to the area of triangle $ACB$ is $\\left(\\frac{AD}{AC}\\right)^2=\\frac{1}{4}$.  Therefore, the ratio of the area of trapezoid $DEBC$ to the area of triangle $ABC$ is $1-\\dfrac{1}{4}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(7cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\npair A=(0,5), B=(8,0), C=(0,0), P=(1.5,1.7);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw((A+C)/2--(A+B)/2,dashed);\ndot(P);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SW);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(A+C)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(A+B)/2,NE);\ndraw((0,0.4)--(0.4,0.4)--(0.4,0));[/asy]",
