    "solution": "We will subtract the probability that the product is odd from 1 to get the probability that the product is even. In order for the product to be odd, we must have both numbers be odd. There are $2\\cdot2=4$ possibilities for this (a 3 or 5 is spun on the left spinner and a 5 or 7 on the right) out of a total of $3\\cdot4=12$ possibilities, so the probability that the product is odd is $4/12=1/3$. The probability that the product is even is $1-1/3=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

How many possible outcomes are there in total for these two spinners, and what are they?\n3. What are the possible products that can be obtained from spinning these two spinners?\n4. How many of the products are even numbers?\n5. What is the strategy we can use to find the probability that the product is an even number?\n6. How do we calculate the probability that the product is an odd number?\n7. Why do we subtract the probability of the product being odd from 1 to get the probability of the product being even?\n8. What is the probability that we spin a 3 and a 5 on these two spinners?\n9. How many ways are there to spin an even number on the left spinner?\n10. Can we use the same method to find the probability of obtaining a prime number as the product of these two spinners? Why or why not?"
