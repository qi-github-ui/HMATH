    "problem": "We flip a fair coin 10 times.  What is the probability that we get heads in at least 8 of the 10 flips?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible outcomes of the 10 coin flips. The number of ways to get 8, 9, or 10 heads is $\\binom{10}{8}+\\binom{10}{9}+\\binom{10}{10}=45+10+1=56$.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{56}{1024}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{128}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of possible outcomes when flipping a fair coin 10 times?\n2. How can we determine the number of ways to get heads in at least 8 of the 10 flips?\n3. Can you explain what the term \"binomial coefficient\" (written as \"n choose k\" or \"C(n, k)\") represents in this context?\n4. How can we calculate the number of ways to get 8, 9, or 10 heads using binomial coefficients?\n5. What is the significance of summing the individual binomial coefficients for 8, 9, and 10 heads?\n6. How can we determine the probability by dividing the total favorable outcomes by the total possible outcomes?\n7. Why do we divide the total number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes in probability calculations?\n8. Can you explain why the resulting probability is expressed as a fraction rather than a decimal or percentage?\n9. Can you generalize this problem to find the probability of getting heads in at least a certain number of flips with a different number of total flips?\n10. Considering the outcome of this problem, what insights can you draw about the likelihood of getting a specific outcome in a series of coin flips?"
