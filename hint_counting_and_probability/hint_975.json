    "solution": "The hexagons in the second column to the left must be yellow and green, but either color can be on top: 2 possibilities. With either possibility, the rest of the figure is easily colored in, with the color of every other hexagon being forced.  (ex. In the third column, the middle hexagon must be red, and the top and bottom must be the opposite of the top and bottom in the second column)  Thus, there are only $\\boxed{2}$ possibilities.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the initial steps you would take to start solving the problem?\n2. How would you determine the possible colors for the hexagons in the figure?\n3. What are the restrictions or rules that need to be followed in coloring the hexagons?\n4. How would you use the information given about the second column to narrow down the possibilities?\n5. Can you explain why there are only 2 possibilities when considering the second column?\n6. How would you continue the coloring process based on the determined colors so far?\n7. Are there any other restrictions or dependencies that need to be considered when coloring the rest of the hexagons?\n8. How confident are you in the final answer of 2? Can you justify your reasoning?"
