    "problem": "What is the second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Every positive integer appears in Pascal's triangle! The number 1000 appears in the row that starts 1, 1000. Then 1001 appears in the next row. So, the answer is $\\boxed{1001}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is Pascal's triangle and how is it constructed?\n2. How are the numbers in each row of Pascal's triangle generated?\n3. Can you explain the pattern or rule behind the numbers in Pascal's triangle?\n4. How can we determine the size of each row in Pascal's triangle?\n5. What are the values in the row that starts with 1, 1000 in Pascal's triangle?\n6. How can we find the second smallest four-digit number in Pascal's triangle based on the given row?\n7. Are there any other rows in Pascal's triangle that contain four-digit numbers? If so, which ones?\n8. Is there a general method or formula for finding any specific number in Pascal's triangle?\n9. Can you explain the significance or applications of Pascal's triangle and its patterns in mathematics?\n10. Can you think of other mathematical concepts or patterns that might have similar properties or constructions as Pascal's triangle?"
