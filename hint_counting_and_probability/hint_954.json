    "problem": "Tamika selects two different numbers at random from the set $\\{8,9,10\\}$ and adds them. Carlos takes two different numbers at random from the set $\\{3,5,6\\}$ and multiplies them. What is the probability that Tamika's result is greater than Carlos' result?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "Tamika can get the numbers $8+9=17$, $8+10=18$, or $9+10=19$. Carlos can get $3\\times5=15$, $3\\times6=18$, or $5\\times6=30$. The possible ways to pair these are: $(17,15)$, $(17,18)$, $(17,30)$, $(18,15)$, $(18,18)$, $(18,30)$, $(19,15)$, $(19,18)$, $(19,30)$. Four of these nine pairs show Tamika with a higher result, so the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the problem in your own words?\n2. What is the set of numbers that Tamika selects from? What is the set of numbers that Carlos selects from?\n3. What are the possible sums that Tamika can get? What are the possible products that Carlos can get?\n4. How many pairs of numbers are there in total? Can you list them out?\n5. Which pairs of numbers result in Tamika having a higher result than Carlos? How many are there?\n6. What is the probability of Tamika's result being greater than Carlos' result? How did you arrive at this answer? \n7. If the sets of numbers that Tamika and Carlos select from were different, would the probability change? Why or why not?"
