    "solution": "The numbers on one die total $1+2+3+4+5+6=21$, so the numbers on the three dice total 63. Numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are visible, and these total 22. This leaves $63-22=\\boxed{41}$ not seen.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the given problem and what it is asking for?\n2. What information do we have about the dice and their faces?\n3. How many faces are visible and how many are hidden in this view?\n4. Can you determine the total number of dots on the visible faces?\n5. How can we calculate the total number of dots on all three dice?\n6. What is the difference between the total number of dots on all three dice and the total number of dots on the visible faces?\n7. How can we find the total number of dots not visible in this view?\n8. Can you explain why the visible faces total 22?\n9. How would you apply the principle of subtraction to find the number of dots not seen?\n10. What is the final answer to the problem and how did you arrive at it?"
