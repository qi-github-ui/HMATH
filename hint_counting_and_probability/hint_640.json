    "problem": "The Cubs are playing the Red Sox in the World Series. To win the world series, a team must win 4 games before the other team does. If the Cubs win each game with probability $\\dfrac{3}{5}$ and there are no ties, what is the probability that the Cubs will win the World Series? Express your answer as a percent rounded to the nearest whole percent.",

    "solution": "There are four possible cases for the Cubs winning the World Series, depending on the number of games that Red Sox win before the Cubs win their fourth game: the Red Sox can win no games, one game, two games, or three games. In general, if the Red Sox win exactly $k$ games before the Cubs win their 4th game, there will be a total of $3+k$ games played before the last one (which the Cubs must win), there will be a total of $\\dbinom{3+k}{k}$ ways of selecting the games that the Red Sox win out of those, and for each of those arrangements the Cubs will win their 4 games with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4$ and the Red Sox will win the $k$ games that are selected for them with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^k$, so we are left to evaluate the expression $\\dbinom{3+k}{k}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$. This gives us our final probability of  \\begin{align*}\n&\\dbinom{3}{0}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^0 + \\dbinom{3+1}{1}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^1 + \\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad\\dbinom{3+2}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^2 + \\dbinom{3+3}{3}\\left(\\dfrac{3}{5}\\right)^4\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5}\\right)^3\n\\end{align*} which simplifies to  \\begin{align*}\n&\\ \\ \\ \\ 1\\cdot(.1296)\\cdot1+4\\cdot(.1296)\\cdot(.4)\\\\\n&+10\\cdot(.1296)\\cdot(.16)+20\\cdot(.1296)\\cdot(.064)=.7102\\ldots,\n\\end{align*} so our answer is $\\boxed{71}$ percent.",
