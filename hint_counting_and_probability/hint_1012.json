    "solution": "We are interested in how many numbers among $7, 8, 9, \\dots, 59$ are relatively prime to 15.\n\nFirst, we count how many numbers among $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 60$ are relatively prime to 15.  Note that $15 = 3 \\cdot 5$.  Among these 60 numbers, $60/3 = 20$ are multiples of 3, $60/5 = 12$ are multiples of 5, and $60/15 = 4$ are multiples of 15.  We can take 60, and subtract 20 and 12, but we have subtracted the multiples of 15 twice.  Therefore, among the 60 numbers, there are $60 - 20 - 12 + 4 = 32$ numbers that are relatively prime to 15.\n\nGoing back to the set $7, 8, 9, \\dots, 59$, we must account for the numbers 1, 2, and 4 that are relatively prime to 15.  Thus, the answer is $32 - 3 = \\boxed{29}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of \"relatively prime numbers\"?\n2. What does it mean for a number to be \"greater than 6 but less than 60\"?\n3. In order to determine the number of natural numbers between 6 and 60 that are relatively prime to 15, what approach can we take?\n4. Why do we need to count the numbers between 1 and 60 that are relatively prime to 15?\n5. Can you explain the reasoning behind subtracting the multiples of 3, multiples of 5, and multiples of 15 in the calculation?\n6. Why do we need to add back the multiples of 15 and subtract them twice in the calculation?\n7. Now that we have the count of natural numbers between 1 and 60 that are relatively prime to 15, how can we find the count within the range of 7 to 59?\n8. Can you explain why we need to subtract the numbers 1, 2, and 4 from the count obtained previously?"
