    "problem": "Juan rolls a fair regular octahedral die marked with the numbers 1 through 8. Then Amal rolls a fair six-sided die. What is the probability that the product of the two rolls is a multiple of 3?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The product will be a multiple of 3 if and only if at least one of the two rolls is a 3 or a 6. The probability that Juan rolls  3 or 6 is $2/8 = 1/4$. The probability that Juan does not roll 3 or 6, but Amal does is $(3/4) (1/3) = 1/4$. Thus, the probability that the product of the rolls is a multiple of 3 is $$\n\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\n$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of outcomes possible when Juan rolls the octahedral die and Amal rolls the six-sided die?\n2. How many outcomes result in the product being a multiple of 3? Can you list them?\n3. If Juan rolls a number other than 3 or 6, does it affect the probability of the product being a multiple of 3? Why or why not?\n4. What is the probability of Juan rolling a 3 or 6?\n5. What is the probability of Amal rolling a 3 or 6?\n6. If Juan rolls a 3 or 6 and Amal rolls any number, what is the probability of the product being a multiple of 3?\n7. If Juan does not roll a 3 or 6, but Amal rolls a 3 or 6, what is the probability of the product being a multiple of 3?\n8. Considering the previous probabilities, what is the overall probability of the product being a multiple of 3?"
