    "problem": "What is the second number in the row of Pascal's triangle that has 43 numbers?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The row 1, 1 has 2 numbers.  The row 1, 2, 1 has 3 numbers.  The row 1, 3, 3, 1 has 4 numbers.  Each time we go down one row, we have one more number in the list.  So, the row that starts 1, $k$ has $k+1$ numbers (namely, the numbers $\\binom{k}{0}, \\binom{k}{1}, \\binom{k}{2}, \\ldots, \\binom{k}{k}$.)  So the row with 43 numbers starts 1, $\\boxed{42}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many numbers are in the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1, 42? \n2. What is the relationship between the number of numbers in a row and its starting number? \n3. Can you explain why the row that starts with 1, 42 has 43 numbers? \n4. Can you generalize the relationship between the starting number and the number of numbers in a row? \n5. Can you find the second number in the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1, 42? \n6. How does the position of a number in the row relate to its value or calculation method? \n7. Can you determine the values of other numbers in the row based on the patterns you observe?"
