    "problem": "How many 3-letter words can we make from the letters A, B, C, and D, if we are allowed to repeat letters, and we must use the letter A at least once? (Here, a word is an arbitrary sequence of letters.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $4^3$ three letter words from A, B, C, and D, and there are $3^3$ three letter words from just B, C, and D. There must, then, be $4^3 - 3^3=64-27 = \\boxed{37}$ words from A, B, C, and D containing at least one A.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the problem using your own words?\n2. What are the specific conditions for forming a 3-letter word in this problem?\n3. How many total 3-letter words can be made using the letters A, B, C, and D, if we are allowed to repeat letters without any restrictions?\n4. How many 3-letter words can be made from just the letters B, C, and D if we are allowed to repeat letters without any restrictions?\n5. How many 3-letter words can be made using the letters A, B, C, and D, if we are required to use at least one A and can repeat letters?\n6. How did you determine the total number of words that contain at least one A?\n7. Can you explain why we subtracted the number of words from just B, C, and D from the total number of 3-letter words?\n8. Can you think of any other similar problems that involve permutations and combinations?"
