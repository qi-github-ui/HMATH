    "problem": "April has four different basil plants and four different tomato plants. In how many ways can she arrange the plants in a row if she puts all the tomato plants next to each other?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First, consider arranging the four basil plants and the one group of tomato plants (not worrying about the order of the tomato plants within the group). There are $5!=120$ ways to arrange them. Then, for each arrangement, there are $4!=24$ ways to arrange the plants in the group of tomato plants. Therefore, there are a total of $120\\cdot24=\\boxed{2880}$ ways for April to arrange her plants such that all the tomato plants are next to each other.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find?\n2. How many basil plants does April have in total?\n3. How many tomato plants does April have in total?\n4. If all the tomato plants are placed next to each other, how many plants are there in the group?\n5. Can we treat the group of tomato plants as a single entity? Why or why not?\n6. How many ways can we arrange the group of tomato plants in a row?\n7. If we treat the group of tomato plants as a single entity, how many \"objects\" are left to arrange?\n8. How many ways can we arrange the remaining basil plants and the group of tomato plants (as a single entity)?\n9. Can we combine the arrangements of the basil plants and the group of tomato plants separately? Why or why not?\n10. How can we calculate the total number of ways to arrange the plants given the arrangement of the group of tomato plants and the remaining basil plants?"
