    "solution": "It is easier to count the number of integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. We see there are 12 perfect squares from 1 to 150, namely $1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\ldots, 12^{2}$, and there are 5 perfect cubes, namely $1^{3}, \\ldots, 5^{3}$. Then notice there are two repetitions, $1^{6} =1^2 = 1^3 = 1$ and $2^{6} = 8^2 = 4^3 = 64$. So there is a total of $12+5-2=15$ integers from 1 to 150 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Thus, we get $150-15=135$ integers from 1 to 150 that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes. So the probability that we select such a number is $\\frac{135}{150} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{10}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the main concept being discussed in this problem?\n2. How many perfect squares are there between 1 and 150? Can you list them?\n3. How many perfect cubes are there between 1 and 150? Can you list them?\n4. Are there any numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes between 1 and 150?\n5. What is the total number of integers between 1 and 150 that are either perfect squares or perfect cubes?\n6. How can we calculate the number of integers between 1 and 150 that are neither perfect squares nor perfect cubes?\n7. Can you calculate the probability of selecting a number that is neither a perfect square nor a perfect cube now? Express your answer as a fraction.\n8. Is it possible for the probability to be greater than 1 or less than 0? Why or why not?\n9. Can you think of any other similar problems where the concept of counting and probability can be applied?"
