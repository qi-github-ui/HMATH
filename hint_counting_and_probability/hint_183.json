    "problem": "Alli rolls a standard $6$-sided die twice. What is the probability of rolling integers that differ by $2$ on her first two rolls? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We have to use a little bit of casework to solve this problem because some numbers on the die have a positive difference of $2$ when paired with either of two other numbers (for example, $3$ with either $1$ or $5$) while other numbers will only have a positive difference of $2$ when paired with one particular number (for example, $2$ with $4$).\n\nIf the first roll is a $1,$ $2,$ $5,$ or $6,$ there is only one second roll in each case that will satisfy the given condition, so there are $4$ combinations of rolls that result in two integers with a positive difference of $2$ in this case. If, however, the first roll is a $3$ or a $4,$ in each case there will be two rolls that satisfy the given condition- $1$ or $5$ and $2$ or $6,$ respectively. This gives us another $4$ successful combinations for a total of $8.$\n\nSince there are $6$ possible outcomes when a die is rolled, there are a total of $6\\cdot6=36$ possible combinations for two rolls, which means our probability is $\\dfrac{8}{36}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{9}}.$\n\nOR\n\nWe can also solve this problem by listing all the ways in which the two rolls have a positive difference of $2:$ $$(6,4), (5,3), (4,2), (3,1), (4,6), (3,5), (2,4), (1,3).$$  So, we have $8$ successful outcomes out of $6\\cdot 6 = 36$ possibilities, which produces a probability of $8/36 = 2/9.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking for? Can you restate it in your own words?\n2. How many sides does the die have? How many possible outcomes are there for each roll?\n3. How many possible combinations are there when rolling the die twice? How did you determine this?\n4. Can you explain the concept of \"positive difference of 2\" in this context?\n5. Can you identify the different cases when the first roll is considered? How did you determine the number of successful combinations in each case?\n6. Can you explain why the first roll has only one successful outcome for some cases, but two successful outcomes for other cases?\n7. How did you calculate the total number of successful outcomes?\n8. How did you calculate the probability of rolling integers that differ by 2 on the first two rolls?\n9. Can you explain the reasoning behind the alternative solution using a list of outcomes?\n10. Can you think of any other scenarios where this concept of calculating probabilities can be applied?"
