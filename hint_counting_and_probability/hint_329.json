    "problem": "The digits $1,2,3,4$ and $5$ can be arranged to form many different $5$-digit positive integers with five distinct digits. In how many such integers is the digit $1$ to the left of the digit $2$?  (The digits 1 and 2 do not have to be next to each other.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "For the first digit, we have 5 choices, then we have 4 choices left for the second digit, then 3 choices for the third digit, etc. So there are $5!=120$ arrangements of the digits. Notice that for each arrangement with 1 to the left of 2, we can reverse the arrangement so that 2 is to the left of 1. For instance, flipping 31245 results in 54213. So by symmetry, exactly half of the arrangements have 1 to the left of 2. In $\\frac{120}{2}=\\boxed{60}$ integers, the digit 1 is to the left of the digit 2.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. How many choices do we have for the first digit? And for the second digit?\n3. Why do we multiply the number of choices for each digit together?\n4. How many different arrangements can we form using all five digits?\n5. Why can we reverse each arrangement with 1 to the left of 2 to get an arrangement with 2 to the left of 1? \n6. How does symmetry help us determine the number of arrangements with 1 to the left of 2?\n7. Can you calculate the number of integers where 1 is to the left of 2 using the given information?"
