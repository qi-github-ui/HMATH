    "problem": "William is taking the 25-question, multiple choice American Mathematics Competition. Each question has five answer choices. William guesses random answers for the last four questions. What is the probability that he will get at least one of these final four questions right?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We find the probability that William misses the last four questions, and subtract from 1. The probability of William missing a question is $\\frac{4}{5}$, so the probability that he misses all four is $\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{256}{625}$. The probability that he gets at least one right is $1-\\frac{256}{625} =\\boxed{\\frac{369}{625}}$.",

How many questions are there in the American Mathematics Competition, and how many answer choices are there for each question?\n3. What is the probability of guessing a correct answer to a question in the American Mathematics Competition?\n4. How many questions is William guessing on in the American Mathematics Competition?\n5. What is the probability of William missing a question he guesses on?\n6. What is the probability of William missing all four questions he guesses on?\n7. How can we find the probability of William getting at least one of the last four questions right?\n8. Why do we subtract the probability of William missing all four questions from 1 to find the probability of him getting at least one question right?\n9. Can we use the same method to find the probability of William getting at least two or three of the last four questions right?\n10. How can we use counting and probability principles to solve more complicated problems involving multiple choice questions and guessing?"
