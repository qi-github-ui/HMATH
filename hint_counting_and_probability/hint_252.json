    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "For each ball, there are 2 choices of which box to place it in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together.  Hence there are $2^4 = \\boxed{16}$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many balls are there in total that need to be placed into the boxes?\n2. Are the balls all the same or do they have some distinguishing features?\n3. How many boxes are available to place the balls into?\n4. Are the boxes all the same or do they have some distinguishing features?\n5. Can a box be left empty, or are all the balls required to be placed in a box?\n6. Are there any restrictions or limitations on how the balls can be placed in the boxes?\n7. Can more than one ball be placed in the same box?\n8. How many choices are there for placing each individual ball into a box?\n9. Are the choices for placing each ball independent of each other?\n10. How can we calculate the total number of ways to place the balls into the boxes?"
