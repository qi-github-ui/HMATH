    "problem": "A fair coin is tossed six times and the sequence of heads and tails is recorded. What is the probability that the sequence contains exactly two heads? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "There are a total of $2^6=64$ equally likely sequences of heads and tails we could record from the fair coin, since heads and tails are equally likely for each of the six tosses.  This is the denominator of our probability.  Now, we need the number of sequences that contain exactly two heads.  We can think of this as counting the number of sequences of T and H of length six where H appears exactly twice.  The number of such sequences will be equal to the number of ways to choose the two positions for H, which is $\\dbinom{6}{2}=15$.  Thus, the final probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{64}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of possible sequences that can be recorded when tossing a fair coin six times?\n2. Are all the possible sequences equally likely? Why or why not?\n3. How many sequences have exactly two heads? Can you explain why this is the case?\n4. How can we calculate the number of sequences with exactly two heads? Can you explain the reasoning behind it?\n5. What is the specific formula or concept we can use to solve this problem?\n6. Can you explain the meaning of the notation \"$\\dbinom{n}{k}$\" that was used to count the number of sequences with exactly two heads?\n7. How did we use the formula \"$\\dbinom{n}{k}$\" in this scenario to calculate the desired probability?\n8. What is the final probability that the sequence contains exactly two heads? Can you explain how we arrived at this fraction?"
