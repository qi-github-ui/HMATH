    "problem": "Johnny has 7 different colored marbles in his bag.  In how many ways can he choose three different marbles from his bag to play a game?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "He can choose 3 marbles from 7 distinct marbles in $\\binom{7}{3}=\\boxed{35}$ ways.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the fundamental principle that we use in determining the number of ways Johnny can choose three marbles?\n2. How many marbles does Johnny have in his bag, and why is this information important in solving the problem?\n3. Can Johnny choose the same marble multiple times, or does he have to choose three distinct marbles? Why is this important to consider?\n4. What does the notation $\\binom{7}{3}$ represent, and how does it relate to the problem at hand?\n5. Can you explain the reasoning behind the formula for combinations, and why it gives us the number of ways Johnny can choose three marbles from his bag?\n6. If Johnny had 10 different colored marbles instead, how many ways could he choose three to play a game? Can you demonstrate how to calculate this using the same principle we used for the original problem?"
