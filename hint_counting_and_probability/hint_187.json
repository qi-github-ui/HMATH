    "solution": "There are 30 days in June. The probability that it rains on exactly 0, 1, or 2 days is  \\begin{align*}&\\ \\ \\ \\ \\binom{30}{0}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{10}\\bigg)^{\\!0}\\bigg(\\frac{9}{10}\\bigg)^{\\!30}\\\\&+\\binom{30}{1}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{10}\\bigg)^{\\!1}\\bigg(\\frac{9}{10}\\bigg)^{\\!29}\\\\&+\\binom{30}{2}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{10}\\bigg)^{\\!2}\\bigg(\\frac{9}{10}\\bigg)^{\\!28} \\\\\n&\\approx \\boxed{0.411}.\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given probability of getting rain on any given day in June?\n2. How can we calculate the probability of raining on exactly 0 days in June? What formula or concept can we use?\n3. Can you explain the reasoning behind the formula for calculating the probability of raining on exactly 0 days?\n4. How does the formula for calculating the probability of raining on exactly 1 day in June differ from the one for 0 days? What do the different parts of the formula represent?\n5. What do the combinations (binomial coefficients) in the formula represent? How are they related to the number of rainy days in June?\n6. How would you calculate the probability of raining on exactly 2 days in June? Can you explain the reasoning behind the formula?\n7. Can you explain why we can add the probabilities of raining on 0, 1, and 2 days to find the probability of raining on at most 2 days? Is there a general principle or concept behind this?\n8. Can you provide an interpretation of the final result we obtained, expressed as a decimal?"
