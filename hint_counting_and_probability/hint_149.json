    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "In this problem we don't care which box is which, we only care which balls are together and which ones aren't.\n\nFor each ball, there are 2 choices of which box to place it in.  Since this choice is independent for each of the 4 balls, we multiply the number of choices together.  Hence there are $2^4 = 16$ ways to place 4 distinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.\n\nWe then divide by the number of ways to arrange the boxes.  There are $2!=2$ ways to arrange the 2 boxes, so there are $\\frac{16}{2} = \\boxed{8}$ ways to arrange 4 distinguishable balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes.\n\nNote: This method does not generalize if there are more than 2 boxes.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the main objective of this problem? Can you explain what we are trying to count?\n2. How many choices do we have for each ball when placing them into the boxes? Why?\n3. How can we determine the total number of ways to put the 4 balls into the 2 boxes when the boxes are indistinguishable?\n4. Are the choices for placing each ball independent of each other? Why or why not?\n5. How can we calculate the total number of ways to place the 4 balls if the boxes were distinguishable instead? Why do we need to make this adjustment?\n6. Why do we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of ways to arrange the boxes? What does this tell us about the problem?\n7. Can you explain why the method used in this problem does not generalize if there are more than 2 boxes?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios or problems where a similar thought process and steps could be used?"
