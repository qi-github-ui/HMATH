    "problem": "John has 6 green marbles and 4 purple marbles. He chooses a marble at random, writes down its color, and then puts the marble back.  He performs this process 5 times. What is the probability that he chooses exactly two green marbles?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which two of the five marbles John chose were green. For any of those 10 choices, there is a $\\left( \\frac{6}{10} \\right) ^2 \\left( \\frac{4}{10} \\right) ^3 = \\frac{72}{3125}$ chance for that choice to happen. The total probability is then $10 \\cdot \\frac{72}{3125}= \\boxed{\\frac{144}{625}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of marbles that John has?\n2. How many green marbles does John have? How many purple marbles?\n3. When John chooses a marble, does he put it back or keep it?\n4. How many marbles does John choose in total?\n5. What does it mean for John to choose \"exactly two green marbles\"?\n6. How many ways can John choose which two of the marbles are green? Why?\n7. For a specific choice of two green marbles, what is the probability of that choice happening?\n8. How can we calculate the probability for any of the 10 choices?\n9. What is the probability for each individual choice? \n10. How do we find the overall probability of John choosing exactly two green marbles?"
