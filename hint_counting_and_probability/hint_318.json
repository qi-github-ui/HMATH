    "problem": "A play has two different male roles, two different female roles and two different roles that can be either gender. Only a man can be assigned to a male role, and only a woman can be assigned to a female role. If five men and six women audition, in how many ways can the six roles be assigned?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We start with the most restrictive conditions: the roles that are not open to both men and women.  First, we will fill the two male roles. There are 5 men, so there are $5 \\cdot 4= 20$ ways to assign 2 of the 5 men to the distinct male roles. Doing the same for the female roles, there are $6 \\cdot 5 = 30$ ways. Finally, of the $5+6 - 2 - 2 = 7$ remaining actors, there are $7 \\cdot 6 = 42$ ways to assign the leftovers to the either-gender roles. Multiplying, there are $20 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 42 = \\boxed{25200}$ ways of assigning the six roles.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the different types of roles in the play and what are the restrictions on who can be assigned to each role?\n2. Why do we start with the most restrictive conditions when calculating the total number of ways the roles can be assigned?\n3. How many ways can we assign the two male roles given that there are 5 men auditioning?\n4. How many ways can we assign the two female roles given that there are 6 women auditioning?\n5. How many actors are left after the male and female roles have been filled and how many either-gender roles are there?\n6. How many ways can we assign the actors left over to the either-gender roles?\n7. How do we calculate the total number of ways the six roles can be assigned using the individual counts for each type of role? \n8. Can you think of any other scenarios where we would need to calculate the total number of ways to assign roles with restrictions on who can be assigned to each role?"
