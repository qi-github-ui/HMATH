    "problem": "I have five apples and ten oranges. If a fruit basket must contain at least one piece of fruit, how many kinds of fruit baskets can I make?  (The apples are identical and the oranges are identical.  A fruit basket consists of some number of pieces of fruit, and it doesn't matter how the fruit are arranged in the basket.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "For a moment, consider empty fruit baskets. Now there are $6$ choices total for the apples: no apples, one apple, two apples, three, four, or all five apples. Similarly, there are $11$ choices total for the oranges. Thus, there are $6\\cdot 11 = 66$ potential fruit baskets. But we must subtract one off of that because we counted empty fruit baskets, which aren't actually allowed. So there are $\\boxed{65}$ possible fruit baskets.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find? \n2. Can you restate the problem in your own words? \n3. How many apples do we have? How many oranges do we have? \n4. What does it mean for two fruits to be identical? \n5. Can you think of a strategy to approach this problem? \n6. Let's consider the case where we have only apples in the fruit basket. How many options do we have? \n7. How about the case where we have only oranges in the fruit basket? \n8. Can we combine the options from the previous two cases to find the total number of fruit basket possibilities? \n9. Are there any restrictions on the number of fruits in each basket? \n10. What happens when we consider an empty fruit basket? \n11. How does that affect the total number of possibilities? \n12. Can we now calculate the total number of fruit basket options?"
