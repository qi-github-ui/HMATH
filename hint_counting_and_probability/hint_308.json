    "problem": "Three tiles are marked X and two other tiles are marked O. The five tiles are randomly arranged in a row. What is the probability that the arrangement reads XOXOX?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are three X's and two O's, and the tiles are selected without replacement, so the probability is \\[\n\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{2}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1}= \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]OR\n\nThe three tiles marked X are equally likely to lie in any of $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ positions, so the probability of this arrangement is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define probability in this context? \n2. Why are there 10 possible positions for the three X's in the arrangement? \n3. Can you explain why each of the factors in the probability expression involves multiplying different fractions? \n4. What does it mean when we say that the tiles are selected without replacement? How does this affect the calculation of the probability? \n5. Can you think of any other situation where selecting items without replacement would affect the probability calculation? \n6. How does the concept of combinations (as shown in the calculation $\\binom{5}{3}$) relate to the probability of this specific arrangement? \n7. If we wanted to calculate the probability of a different arrangement, how would we modify the calculation? \n8. Is there any other way to approach this problem and calculate the probability of the XOXOX arrangement? \n9. How would the probability change if there were a different number of X's and O's in the original set of tiles? \n10. Can you think of any real-life scenarios where understanding probability and counting would be useful?"
