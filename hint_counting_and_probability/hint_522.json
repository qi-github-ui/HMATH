    "problem": "On a standard die one of the dots is removed at random with each dot equally likely to be chosen. The die is then rolled. What is the probability that the top face has an odd number of dots?",

    "solution": "The dot is chosen from the face with $n$ dots with probability $\\frac{n}{21}$. Thus the face that originally has $n$ dots is left with an odd number of dots with probability $\\frac{n}{21}$ if $n$ is even and $1 - n/21$ if $n$ is odd. Each face is the top face with probability $\\frac{1}{6}$. Therefore the top face has an odd number of dots with probability \\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{1}{6}\\displaystyle\\left(\\displaystyle\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{21}\\displaystyle\\right) + \\frac{2}{21} + \\displaystyle\\left(1 - \\frac{3}{21}\\displaystyle\\right)\n+ \\frac{4}{21} + \\displaystyle\\left(1 - \\frac{5}{21}\\displaystyle\\right) + \\frac{6}{21}\\displaystyle\\right) \\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{1}{6} \\displaystyle\\left(3 + \\frac{3}{21}\\displaystyle\\right)\\\\\n& \\qquad = \\frac{1}{6}\\cdot \\frac{66}{21} \\\\\n& \\qquad = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{21}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find? \n2. How is the dot removed from the die? \n3. What is the probability that a face with $n$ dots is left with an odd number of dots after a dot has been removed? \n4. How do we determine the probability that each face will be the top face after the die is rolled? \n5. What is the final expression we use to calculate the overall probability of the top face having an odd number of dots? \n6. Can you think of other similar problems involving probability and random events? \n7. How can we apply the concept of conditional probability to this problem? \n8. What would change if we were to remove two dots instead of one before rolling the die?"
