    "problem": "In the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 12, what is the fourth number?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The row that starts 1, 12 is the row $\\binom{12}{0}, \\binom{12}{1}, \\binom{12}{2},\\binom{12}{3}$, so the fourth number in this row is $\\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12\\cdot 11\\cdot 10}{3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = \\boxed{220}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what Pascal's triangle is and how it is constructed?\n2. How does the row of Pascal's triangle that starts with 1 and then 12 relate to combinations or binomial coefficients?\n3. What does the notation $\\binom{12}{3}$ mean and how is it calculated?\n4. What are the factors in the numerator and denominator of $\\binom{12}{3}$ and how are they related to the problem?\n5. Can you provide a step-by-step explanation of how to calculate $\\binom{12}{3}$ using the factorial notation?\n6. Are there any other patterns or properties of Pascal's triangle that can be observed from this problem?"
