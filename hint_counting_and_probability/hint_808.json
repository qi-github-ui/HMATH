    "problem": "My soccer team has 16 players.  I have to choose a starting lineup of a goalie and 10 regular players (the regular players are interchangeable).  How many different starting lineups can I choose?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First we choose the goalie, and any of the 16 people can be the goalie. Then we choose 10 more players from the remaining 15 players, which is the same as choosing a committee. The answer is \\[16\\binom{15}{10}=16\\binom{15}{5}=16\\times\\frac{15\\times 14\\times 13\\times 12\\times 11}{5\\times 4\\times 3\\times 2\\times 1}=\\boxed{48,\\!048}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find?\n2. How many players are on the soccer team, and how many players do we need to choose for the starting lineup?\n3. How do we determine the number of ways to choose a starting lineup?\n4. What does it mean for the regular players to be interchangeable?\n5. Why do we first choose the goalie separately from the other 10 players?\n6. How do we use the concept of choosing a committee to calculate the number of possible lineups?\n7. Can we use a different method to solve this problem? If so, what would it be?"
