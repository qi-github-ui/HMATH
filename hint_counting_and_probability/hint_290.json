    "problem": "The Grammar club has 20 members: 10 boys and 10 girls.  A 4-person committee is chosen at random.  What is the probability that the committee has at least 1 boy and at least 1 girl?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The number of ways to choose a committee of all boys or all girls is $2\\times\\binom{10}{4}=420$. The total number of committees is $\\binom{20}{4}=4845$. Thus the answer is $1-\\dfrac{420}{4845} = \\dfrac{4425}{4845} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{295}{323}}$.",

What does \"at least 1 boy and at least 1 girl\" mean? Can you rephrase it in a different way?\n4. How did we calculate the number of ways to choose a committee of all boys or all girls? Is this number important for finding the probability we are looking for?\n5. How did we calculate the total number of committees? What concept does this calculation represent?\n6. What is the formula we can use to calculate the probability of an event? How can we apply it to this scenario?\n7. What is the final probability that we calculated? How does it answer the original question?"
