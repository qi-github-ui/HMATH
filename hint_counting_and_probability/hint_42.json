    "problem": "How many different positive, four-digit integers can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 9 and 9?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 4 distinct digits, there would be $4! = 24$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, and divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digit were different we would have twice as many orderings). So, our answer is $\\frac{4!}{2!\\cdot 2!} = 2 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find? \n2. Can you list the digits that we are allowed to use when forming these four-digit integers? \n3. How many distinct four-digit integers can we form if we don't consider the repeating digits? \n4. How many times have we counted each four-digit integer that has repeating digits? \n5. Can you explain why we divide by 2! twice in our calculation? \n6. Can you think of another problem involving counting and probability that may require correcting for overcounting?"
