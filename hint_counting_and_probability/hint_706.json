    "problem": "The probability it will rain on Saturday is $60\\%$, and the probability it will rain on Sunday is $25\\%$. If the probability of rain on a given day is independent of the weather on any other day, what is the probability it will rain on both days, expressed as a percent?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The probability that both of two independent events will occur is the product of the probabilities of each event.  Therefore, the probability that it will rain on both days is $(60\\%)(25\\%)=\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{20}$.  Multiplying the numerator and denominator of $3/20$ by $5$, we find that the probability that it will rain on both days is $\\boxed{15}$ percent.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean for two events to be independent in the context of probability?\n2. How can we express the probability of rain on Saturday and Sunday as a decimal or fraction?\n3. How can we calculate the probability of two independent events both occurring?\n4. Can you apply the concept of independence to find the probability of rain on both Saturday and Sunday?\n5. Can you calculate the product of the probabilities to determine the probability of rain on both days?\n6. Can you simplify the resulting fraction to express the probability as a percent?\n7. Can you explain why we multiply the numerators and denominators by 5 to find an equivalent fraction?\n8. Are there any assumptions or conditions that need to be met in order for the multiplication rule to apply? If so, what are they?\n9. Can you think of any real-life scenarios where the multiplication rule for probabilities would be applicable?\n10. How would the approach change if the events were not independent?"
