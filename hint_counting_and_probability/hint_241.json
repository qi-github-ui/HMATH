    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The ways to arrange indistinguishable balls into indistinguishable boxes only depends on the number of balls in the boxes.  The ways to do this are $(5,0,0)$, $(4,1,0)$, $(3,2,0)$, $(3,1,1)$, $(2,2,1)$.  There are $\\boxed{5}$ ways.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the problem statement in your own words?\n2. What are distinguishable balls and boxes? How is this problem different from the one with distinguishable balls and indistinguishable boxes?\n3. How many balls are there in total? And how many boxes are there?\n4. Is there a restriction on the number of balls that each box can contain?\n5. Can you briefly describe each of the five possible ways to distribute the balls into the boxes?\n6. Can you explain why there are only 5 possible ways to distribute the balls and not more?\n7. Can you explain how you arrived at the final answer of 5? Is there a formula or method that you used?\n8. Can you think of a similar problem where the balls and boxes are both distinguishable? How would the solution differ from this problem?"
