    "problem": "At breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Joe randomly chooses with equal probabilities either an apple, an orange, or a banana to eat. On a given day, what is the probability that Joe will eat at least two different kinds of fruit?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The only way for Joe not to eat at least two different kinds of fruit is if he eats all apples, all oranges, or all bananas. The probability that he eats all apples is $\\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) ^3=\\frac{1}{27}$. The probability that he eats all oranges and the probability that he eats all bananas are the same. So, the probability that Joe eats at least two different kinds of fruit is $1-\\frac{1}{27}-\\frac{1}{27}-\\frac{1}{27}=\\boxed{\\frac{8}{9}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the possible fruits that Joe can choose from for each meal?\n2. How many different kinds of fruit can Joe choose from?\n3. If Joe randomly chooses for each meal, how many different combinations of fruits can he have?\n4. What is the probability of Joe choosing all apples for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?\n5. What is the probability of Joe choosing all oranges for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?\n6. What is the probability of Joe choosing all bananas for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?\n7. How do you calculate the probability of Joe choosing at least two different fruits? \n8. Can you explain why the probability of Joe choosing exactly two different fruits is the same as the probability of Joe choosing exactly one different fruit?\n9. How would the probability change if Joe had 4 different fruits to choose from instead?\n10. What other scenarios or problems could be related to the concept of choosing fruits randomly like Joe?"
