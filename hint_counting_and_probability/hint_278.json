    "problem": "After a gymnastics meet, each gymnast shook hands once with every gymnast on every team (except herself). Afterwards, a coach came down and only shook hands with each gymnast from her own team. There were a total of 281 handshakes. What is the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The number of gymnasts is some integer $n$, so that the number of gymnast-gymnast handshakes is ${n \\choose 2}$ for some $n$. Also, the coach must participate in an integer $k<n$ number of handshakes. So, ${n \\choose 2} + k = 281$. If we want to minimize $k$, we need the maximal $n$ such that ${n \\choose 2} \\le 281$, which implies $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 281$ or $n^2 - n - 562 \\le 0 $. So, the maximal $n$ is 24. So, $k = 281 - {24 \\choose 2} = 281 - 12 \\cdot 23 = 281 - 276 = \\boxed{5}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the scenario described in this problem?\n2. How many gymnasts are there in total and how many teams are there?\n3. How many handshakes are there between just the gymnasts?\n4. In addition to the gymnast-gymnast handshakes, how many handshakes does the coach have to participate in?\n5. How do we express the number of handshakes between just the gymnasts using a formula?\n6. Can we express the total number of handshakes (including the coach) using a formula?\n7. How do we derive the inequality $n^2 - n - 562 \\leq 0$?\n8. How do we solve the inequality $n^2 - n - 562 \\leq 0$ to find the maximal $n$?\n9. How do we calculate the number of handshakes the coach participated in using the maximal $n$?\n10. What is the fewest number of handshakes the coach could have participated in, based on our calculations?"
