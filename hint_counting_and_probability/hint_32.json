    "problem": "A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as 3003. How many positive four-digit integers are palindromes?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Constructing palindromes requires that we choose the thousands digit (which defines the units digit) and the hundreds digit (which defines the tens digit). Since there are 9 choices for the thousands digit, and 10 choices for the hundreds digit, creating $9 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{90}$ palindromes.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you define what a palindrome is in relation to four-digit integers?\n2. How would you approach constructing a palindrome using the thousands and hundreds digits?\n3. How many options do you have for choosing the thousands digit? And how many options do you have for choosing the hundreds digit?\n4. Why do you multiply the number of choices for the thousands digit by the number of choices for the hundreds digit?\n5. Can you explain why the total number of four-digit palindromes is equal to the product of the number of choices for the thousands digit and the number of choices for the hundreds digit?\n6. Can you think of any other situations where this kind of counting technique might be useful?\n7. Is there a general formula or rule that can be applied to calculate the number of palindromes for any given number of digits?\n8. Is it possible to have palindromes with a different number of digits? If so, how would the counting method change?\n9. How would the scenario differ if negative integers were also considered?"
