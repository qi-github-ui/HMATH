    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Choosing a committee is a combination, and order does not matter. We are choosing a 4-person committee from 9 people, so there are $9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6$ ways to pick the four people for the positions, but then we must divide by $4!$ since order doesn't matter, so the answer is $\\dfrac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{4!} =\\boxed{126}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many people are in the club?\n2. How many people need to be chosen for the committee?\n3. Does the order in which the committee members are chosen matter?\n4. How many different ways can we arrange the 4 chosen people in the committee positions?\n5. Why do we need to divide by 4! in the final calculation?\n6. Can you explain why it is a combination and not a permutation?\n7. Can you think of any other scenarios where combination would be used in counting?"
