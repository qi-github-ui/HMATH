    "problem": "How many different four-letter arrangements can be formed using the six letters $A, B, C, D, E$ and $F$, if the first letter must be $C$, one of the other letters must be $B$, and no letter can be used more than once in the arrangement?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There is 1 way to make the first letter C and 3 ways to make one of the other letters B. We now have 4 ways to pick the letter for the first remaining spot and 3 ways to pick the letter for the last remaining spot. This is a total of $1\\cdot3\\cdot4\\cdot3=\\boxed{36}$ ways to arrange the letters.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find? \n2. What are the given restrictions for the arrangements? \n3. How many letters are available to use for the remaining two spots? \n4. How did we determine that there is only 1 way to make the first letter C? \n5. How did we determine that there are 3 ways to make one of the other letters B? \n6. How did we arrive at a total of 36 possible arrangements? \n7. How would the solution change if the restrictions were different (e.g. two letters could be used more than once)? \n8. Can you think of any real-life scenarios where counting and probability are relevant? \n9. How does understanding counting and probability relate to our daily lives?"
