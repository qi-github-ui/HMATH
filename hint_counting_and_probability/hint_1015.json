    "problem": "What is the minimum number of times you must throw three fair six-sided dice to ensure that the same sum is rolled twice?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "In the worst-case scenario, every possible sum is rolled before the same sum is rolled again. The minimum possible sum rolled is $3 \\cdot 1 = 3$, and the maximum is $3 \\cdot 6 = 18$. Every sum in between those two extremes can be created, since the sums are created through adding three of the digits between one and six. Thus, there are $18 - 2 = 16$ possible sums, so the dice must be rolled $\\boxed{17}$ times to ensure that the same sum is rolled twice.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the range of possible sums that can be rolled with three fair six-sided dice?\n2. How many possible sums are there between the minimum and maximum sums?\n3. Why do we subtract 2 when calculating the number of possible sums?\n4. How many times would you need to roll the dice to ensure that at least one sum is repeated?\n5. Can you explain why the worst-case scenario is when every possible sum is rolled before a repetition?\n6. What is the minimum sum that can be rolled with three dice? And the maximum sum?\n7. Can you explain why every sum between the minimum and maximum can be created with three dice?\n8. How does the fact that sums are created by adding three digits between one and six help us calculate the number of possible sums?\n9. Can you describe the specific steps you would take to calculate the minimum number of times the dice must be rolled to ensure a repetition?\n10. Can you think of any other scenarios or problems where a similar approach of calculating possible outcomes could be applied?"
