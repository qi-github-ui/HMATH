    "problem": "Two different numbers are randomly selected from the set $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\\}$. The probability that their sum is 12 would be greater if the number $n$ had first been removed from set $S$. What is the value of $n$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "All of the integers in the set $S$ have exactly one complementary number, $12-x$, such that their sum is 12, except for the number 6. Because $6+6= 12$, and the two numbers chosen are distinct, removing 6 will not eliminate any of the pairs that sum to 12, and it will reduce the total number of pairs possible. So $n=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you restate the problem in your own words?\n2. What is the meaning of \"complementary number\" in this context? \n3. What does it mean when the problem states that removing the number 6 will \"reduce the total number of pairs possible\"? \n4. How many pairs of numbers can be selected from the set $S$? \n5. What is the probability of selecting two numbers from $S$ that sum to 12 without removing any numbers? \n6. How do you calculate the probability of two events occurring one after the other? \n7. What is the probability of selecting a number that is not 6 from set $S$ and then selecting a number that makes a sum of 12 with the first number? \n8. What is the probability of selecting two numbers from $S$ after removing the number 6 that sum to 12? \n9. After removing the number 6, can you determine which pairs of numbers can no longer be selected? \n10. How does the probability of selecting two numbers that sum to 12 change after removing the number 6 from $S$?"
