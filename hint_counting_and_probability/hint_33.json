    "problem": "If the six digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5 and 8 are randomly arranged into a six-digit positive integer, what is the probability that the integer is divisible by 15? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "By the fact that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3, any arrangement of the digits will be a multiple of 3. To be a multiple of 5, the number must end in one of the fives, which will happen with probability $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$. Since any number that is a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5 is a multiple of 15, the probability of it being a multiple of 15 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many arrangements can be made with the six digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, and 8?\n2. What is the criteria for a number to be divisible by 15?\n3. How many digits are required to be a multiple of 15?\n4. Based on the given digits, how many possible ways can the number end in 5?\n5. If we randomly arrange the digits, what is the probability that the number ends in 5?\n6. What is the probability that any arrangement of the digits will be a multiple of 3?\n7. Why is any arrangement of the digits a multiple of 3?\n8. How can we calculate the probability that the number is divisible by 15 based on the probabilities of ending in 5 and being a multiple of 3?\n9. Can you simplify the probability of ending in 5?\n10. What is the probability that the number is divisible by 15?"
