    "problem": "How many three-digit numbers satisfy the property that the middle digit is the average of the first and the last digits?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The first and last digits must be both odd or both even for their average to be an integer.  There are $5\\cdot 5 =25$ odd-odd combinations for the first and last digits.  There are $4\\cdot 5=20$ even-even combinations that do not use zero as the first digit. Hence, the total is $\\boxed{45}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you define what it means for a number to have \"three digits\"?\n2. Can you explain what is meant by the \"middle digit\" of a number?\n3. How would you calculate the average of two numbers?\n4. Why is it important for the first and last digits to be both odd or both even in this problem?\n5. How many odd digits are there, and how many even digits are there?\n6. How many odd-odd combinations can you create using the available odd digits?\n7. How many even-even combinations are possible using the available even digits (excluding zero)?\n8. Can you explain why we are calculating the product of the odd-odd combinations and the even-even combinations?\n9. What is the significance of the result we obtain from multiplying the number of odd-odd combinations by the number of even-even combinations?\n10. Can you provide the final answer to the problem statement and explain how you arrived at it?"
