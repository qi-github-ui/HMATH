    "problem": "Three positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ satisfy $a\\cdot b\\cdot c=8!$ and $a<b<c$.  What is the smallest possible value of $c-a$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Our goal is to divide the factors of 8! into three groups in such a way that the products of the factors in each group are as close together as possible.  Write $8!$ as $8\\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2$.  Observe that $30^3<8!<40^3$, so the cube root of $8!$ is between $30$ and $40$.  With this in mind, we group $7$ and $5$ to make one factor of $35$.  We can also make a factor of $36$ by using $6$ along with $3$ and $2$.  This leaves $8$ and $4$ which multiply to give $32$.  The assignment $(a,b,c)=(32,35,36)$ has the minimum value of $c-a$, since $31$, $33$, $34$, $37$, $38$, and $39$ contain prime factors not present in $8!$.  Therefore, the minimum value of $c-a$ is $\\boxed{4}$.",
