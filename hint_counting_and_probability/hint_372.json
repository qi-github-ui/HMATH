    "solution": "The number of pairs of neighbors for Cara actually has nothing to do with the shape of the table she is sitting at. That is, all that matters is that she has 5 friends and two of them will be her neighbors. There are ${5 \\choose 2} = \\boxed{10}$ pairs of friends that she can thus sit between.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many friends does Cara have?\n2. How many friends does she need to sit between?\n3. Can you explain why the shape of the table does not affect the number of pairs of neighbors for Cara?\n4. How would you calculate the number of pairs of friends that Cara can sit between?\n5. What does the notation ${5 \\choose 2}$ mean? Can you explain its significance in this context?\n6. Can you come up with a different approach to calculate the number of pairs of friends that Cara can sit between?\n7. Can you think of a general formula that can be used in similar situations where the number of friends or neighbors is different?\n8. How would you verify that the calculated number of pairs of friends is correct?\n9. Can you think of any real-life situations where understanding the concept of counting pairs of neighbors would be useful?"
