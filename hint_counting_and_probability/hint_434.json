    "problem": "How many non-empty subsets of $\\{ 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \\}$ consist entirely of odd numbers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We consider the subset $\\{ 1, 3, 5, 7 \\}$ which consists only of the odd integers in the original set. Any subset consisting entirely of odd numbers must be a subset of this particular subset. And, there are $2^4 - 1 = \\boxed{15}$ non-empty subsets of this 4-element set, which we can easily see by making the choice of including or not including each element.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a subset is? \n2. How would you define a non-empty subset? \n3. Can you identify the odd numbers in the given set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$? \n4. How many odd numbers are there in the given set? \n5. Can you explain why any subset consisting entirely of odd numbers must be a subset of $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$? \n6. How many elements are there in the subset $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$? \n7. Can you explain why there are $2^4-1$ non-empty subsets of $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$? \n8. How do you calculate $2^4$? \n9. Why do we subtract 1 from $2^4$ when calculating the number of non-empty subsets of the 4-element set? \n10. Can you generalize these steps to find the number of non-empty subsets that consist entirely of odd numbers for any set of size $n$ where $n$ is an odd integer?"
