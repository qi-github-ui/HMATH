    "problem": "Call a set of integers \"spacy\" if it contains no more than one out of any three consecutive integers.  How many subsets of $\\{1, 2,\n3, \\dots, 12\\}$, including the empty set, are spacy?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "For each positive integer $n$, let $S_n = \\{k:1\\leq k\\leq\nn\\}$, and let $c_n$ be the number of spacy subsets of $S_n$.  Then $c_1=2$, $c_2=3$, and $c_3=4$. For $n\\geq 4$, the spacy subsets of $S_n$ can be partitioned into two types:  those that contain $n$ and those that do not.  Those that do not contain $n$ are precisely the spacy subsets of $S_{n-1}$.  Those that contain $n$ do not contain either $n-1$ or $n-2$ and are therefore in one-to-one correspondence with the spacy subsets of $S_{n-3}$.  It follows that $c_n=c_{n-3}+c_{n-1}$.  Thus the first twelve terms in the sequence $\\left(c_n\\right)$ are $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, $9$, $13$, $19$, $28$, $41$, $60$, $88$, $129$, and there are $c_{12}=\\boxed{129}$ spacy subsets of $S_{12}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define a \"spacy\" set of integers in your own words? Can you give an example of a spacy set?\n2. How many subsets can be formed from a set that contains only one element? Is the empty set considered spacy?\n3. For a set that contains two elements, how many different subsets can be formed? Are all of them spacy?\n4. Can you find a pattern or rule for determining the number of spacy subsets for sets with three elements?\n5. Based on the given information, what is the number of spacy subsets for a set containing four elements? Can you explain how you arrived at your answer?\n6. If a set contains five elements, can you use the information about subsets from the previous questions to determine the number of spacy subsets? Explain your reasoning.\n7. How do subsets that contain the largest element differ from subsets that don't contain it? Can you determine a relationship between these types of subsets?\n8. Using the relationship you found in the previous question, can you find a recursive formula for calculating the number of spacy subsets for larger sets?\n9. Test your recursive formula by calculating the number of spacy subsets for a set with six elements. Does it match the given value in the problem?\n10. How does the recursive formula for the number of spacy subsets relate to the concept of counting and probability? Can you connect it to any other mathematical principles or techniques?\n11. Can you identify any limitations or constraints on the recursive formula that may affect its application to extremely large sets?\n12. What other similar problems or scenarios can you think of that may involve the use of the same reasoning and steps as in this problem?"
