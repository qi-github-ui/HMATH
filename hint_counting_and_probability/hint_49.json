    "solution": "We find the point which is equidistant from 0 and 4. Clearly, this occurs at 2. So, for all $x > 2$, $x$ is closer to 4 than 0. So, the probability is equal to the length of this region $\\frac{5-2}{5} = \\boxed{.6}$.",

Is there a specific point on the number line that is equidistant between 0 and 4? If so, what is it?\n4. What does it mean for a point to be \"closer to 4 than to 0\"?\n5. How can you determine which numbers on the number line are closer to 4 than to 0?\n6. Could you explain the process you would use to find the probability in this problem?\n7. What is the length of the region where numbers are closer to 4 than to 0?\n8. How would you express the probability as a decimal?\n9. What is the final answer, rounded to the nearest tenth?"
