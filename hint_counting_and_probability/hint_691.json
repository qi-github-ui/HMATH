    "problem": "The Rotokas of Papua New Guinea have twelve letters in their alphabet. The letters are: A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, S, T, U, and V. Suppose license plates of five letters utilize only the letters in the Rotoka alphabet. How many license plates of five letters are possible that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no letters that repeat?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The first letter can be G or K, so it has 2 choices. The last letter must be T, so it only has 1 choice. Since no element may repeat, the second letter has 9 choices, any of the 12 letters excluding the first letter, T, and S. Similarly, the third letter has 8 choices, and the fourth 7 choices. So, the number of license plates is $2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{1008}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many letters are there in the Rotokas alphabet?\n2. What are the letters in the Rotokas alphabet?\n3. How many letters can be chosen for the first position in the license plate?\n4. How many letters can be chosen for the last position in the license plate?\n5. Why must the last letter be chosen as T?\n6. How many choices are there for the second letter in the license plate?\n7. How many choices are there for the third letter in the license plate?\n8. How many choices are there for the fourth letter in the license plate?\n9. Why are there 9 choices for the second letter and 8 choices for the third letter?\n10. Can the letters S and T appear in the license plate? Why or why not?\n11. How do you calculate the total number of license plates using the choices we discussed?\n12. What is the final result when you calculate the total number of license plates?"
