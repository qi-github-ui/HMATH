    "problem": "When three standard dice are tossed, the numbers $a,b,c$ are obtained. Find the probability that $$(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) \\neq 0$$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "None of $a,b,c$ are equal to 1 if and only if $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) \\neq 0$. $a,b,c$ can only be $2,3,4,5,6$. The probability of this is $\\frac{5^3}{6^3}=\\boxed{\\frac{125}{216}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define the term \"probability\" in the context of this problem?\n2. Can you explain why $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) \\neq 0$ implies that none of $a, b, c$ can be equal to 1?\n3. What are the possible outcomes when rolling three standard dice?\n4. How many outcomes satisfy the condition $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1) \\neq 0$?\n5. Is it equally likely for each of the outcomes to occur? Why or why not?\n6. Can you calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three dice?\n7. How can we determine the probability using the concept of counting principles?\n8. How would you calculate the probability of obtaining a number that is not 1 for each of $a, b, c$?\n9. Can you simplify the expression $\\frac{5^3}{6^3}$ to a simpler form?\n10. Can you generalize this concept to find the probability when rolling a different number of dice?"
