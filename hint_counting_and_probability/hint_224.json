    "problem": "Two fair, six-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that the sum of the two numbers showing is less than 11?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We instead find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is greater than or equal to 11.  Since each die's face contains the numbers 1-6, there are only 3 pairs of rolls that result in a sum greater than or equal to 11: (5,6), (6,5) and (6,6). Since there are 6 possible results for the roll of each die, there are $6\\times6=36$ possible pairs of rolls, so the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is not less than 11 is $\\frac{3}{36}=\\frac{1}{12}$. Using the idea of complementary probabilities, we know that the probability of an event happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of the event not happening, so the probability of the sum of the numbers showing being less than 11 is $1-\\frac{1}{12}=\\boxed{\\frac{11}{12}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the problem is asking in your own words?\n2. How many possible outcomes are there when rolling two fair, six-sided dice?\n3. Can you list all the possible outcomes and their corresponding sums?\n4. How many of these outcomes have a sum less than 11?\n5. Can you explain why we are finding the probability of the sum being greater than or equal to 11 instead?\n6. How did you determine that there are only 3 pairs of rolls that result in a sum greater than or equal to 11?\n7. How did you calculate the total number of possible pairs of rolls?\n8. Why do we use the concept of complementary probabilities in this problem?\n9. How did you calculate the probability of the sum being not less than 11?\n10. Can you explain why we subtract the probability found in step 9 from 1 to get the probability of the sum being less than 11?\n11. What is the final probability that the sum of the numbers showing is less than 11?"
