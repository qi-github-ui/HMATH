    "problem": "I have 5 marbles numbered 1 through 5 in a bag.  Suppose I take out two different marbles at random.  What is the expected value of the sum of the numbers on the marbles?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ different pairs of marbles can be drawn, and the expected value of the sum is the average of the sums of each pair.  This is  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{10}((1+2)+(1+3)+(1+4)+(1+5)+(2+3)&\\\\\n+(2+4)+(2+5)+(3+4)+(3+5)+(4+5))&=\\frac{60}{10} = \\boxed{6}. \\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the basic concept of counting and probability?\n2. How do we calculate the number of ways an event can occur using combinations and permutations?\n3. Can you give an example of a real-life situation where we use counting and probability?\n4. How can we calculate the probability of an event occurring, given certain conditions?\n5. In the given scenario, why is the expected value of the sum of the numbers on the marbles important? \n6. What is the formula for calculating the expected value of a random variable?\n7. How do we apply the formula to the given scenario?\n8. Can you explain how the sample space and probability distribution are related to the expected value?\n9. Are there any limitations to using the expected value as a measure of central tendency in probability distributions? \n10. Can you give an example where the expected value is not a good measure of central tendency?"
