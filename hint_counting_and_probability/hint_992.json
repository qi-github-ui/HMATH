    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The first condition is equivalent to the statement that $a = 4$ or $a = 5$. The second condition is equivalent to the statement that $d = 0$ or $d = 5$. Finally, the third condition is equivalent to the statement that the ordered pair $(b, c)$ is one of the pairs \\[(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6),(5,6).\\]In total, $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6=\\boxed{24}$ four-digit numbers $N$ satisfying the conditions.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What range of numbers are we considering for the four-digit number $N$? Can you restate the first condition in terms of the possible values for the thousands digit $a$? \n2. How can we ensure that $N$ is a multiple of $5$? What values can the units digit $d$ take on?\n3. How can we interpret the condition $3 \\le b < c \\le 6$? What values are restricted for the tens and hundreds digits, $b$ and $c$?\n4. Combining the previous conditions, what are the possible pairs $(b, c)$ that satisfy the third condition? Can you list them?\n5. How can we use the concept of counting to determine the number of possible combinations for the digits $(a, b, c, d)$? What are the different ways these digits can be chosen from the possible values?\n6. Can we express the total number of four-digit numbers $N$ that satisfy all the conditions using the counting principle? How can we calculate this number?"
