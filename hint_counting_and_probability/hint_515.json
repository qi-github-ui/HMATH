    "problem": "In how many ways can I arrange 3 different math books and 5 different history books on my bookshelf, if I require there to be a math book on both ends?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Let's deal with the restriction first.\n\nThe restriction is that we have to place a math book on both ends.  We have 3 choices for the math book to place on the left end, and then 2 choices for the math book to place on the right end.\n\nThen we simply need to arrange the other 6 books in the middle.  This is a basic permutation problem, so there are $6!$ ways to arrange the 6 remaining books.\n\nSo there are a total of $3 \\times 2 \\times 6! = \\boxed{4,\\!320}$ ways to arrange the books on the bookshelf.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you describe the restriction in this problem? \n2. What are the possible choices for the math book on the left end? How many choices do we have for the math book on the right end? \n3. What does it mean to \"arrange the other 6 books in the middle\"? How many ways can we do that? \n4. Why do we multiply the number of choices for the math books with the number of ways to arrange the other books? \n5. Can you think of a different approach to solving this problem? \n6. Are there any other restrictions we could introduce that would change the number of arrangements? "
