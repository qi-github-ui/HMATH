    "problem": "Two standard 6-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that the sum rolled is a perfect square?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Rolling two dice has $6 \\times 6=36$ possible outcomes.  The only perfect squares that we can roll are 4 and 9. Pairs adding up to 4 are 1+3, 2+2, and 3+1. Those that add up to 9 are 3+6, 4+5, 5+4, and 6+3. The answer is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{36}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the term \"probability\" means in this context?\n2. How many possible outcomes are there when rolling two dice?\n3. What are the perfect square sums that we can roll with two dice?\n4. How many pairs of dice rolls result in a sum of 4? Can you list them?\n5. And how many pairs of dice rolls result in a sum of 9? Can you list them?\n6. How did you determine that there are 7 pairs of dice rolls that result in a perfect square sum?\n7. What is the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice?\n8. How can you express the probability of getting a perfect square sum in terms of the total number of possible outcomes?\n9. Can you simplify the probability fraction and express it in its lowest terms?\n10. Based on the calculated probability, is it likely or unlikely to roll a perfect square sum when rolling two dice?\n11. Can you think of any other scenarios or situations where probability and counting principles can be applied similarly?"
