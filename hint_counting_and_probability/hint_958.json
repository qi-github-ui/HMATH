    "problem": "A standard deck of cards has 52 cards divided into 4 suits, each of which has 13 cards.  Two of the suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$, called `hearts' and `diamonds') are red, the other two ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$, called `spades' and `clubs') are black.  The cards in the deck are placed in random order (usually by a process called `shuffling').  What is the probability that the first two cards drawn from the deck are both red?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{first two cards are red}) &= \\frac{\\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\\text{Number of possible outcomes}}\\\\\n&= \\frac{26 \\times 25}{52 \\times 51}\\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{25}{102}}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many cards are there in a standard deck? What are the different suits and how many cards are there in each suit?\n2. What is the probability of drawing a red card from the deck on the first draw? And what is the probability of drawing another red card on the second draw, assuming you didn't replace the first card?\n3. How do you calculate the total number of possible outcomes for the first draw and the second draw?\n4. How do you calculate the number of successful outcomes where both cards drawn are red?\n5. Why do we multiply the number of successful outcomes for each draw to calculate the overall probability?\n6. Can you explain why we divide the number of successful outcomes by the number of possible outcomes to determine the probability?\n7. Can you generalize this situation and calculate the probability of drawing two cards of the same suit, without specifying the color?"
