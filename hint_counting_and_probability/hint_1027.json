    "solution": "From $E$ to $F$, it is 3 steps to the right and 1 step down, for a total of $\\dbinom{4}{1} = \\dfrac{4}{1} = 4$ different paths.  From $F$ to $G$, it is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down, for a total of $\\dbinom{5}{2} = \\dfrac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$ different paths.  So there are $4 \\times 10 = \\boxed{40}$ paths from $E$ to $G$ that pass through $F$.",

How many different paths are there from $E$ to $F$? How did you arrive at this answer? \n4. How many different paths are there from $F$ to $G$? How did you arrive at this answer? \n5. How can you combine the number of paths from $E$ to $F$ and from $F$ to $G$ to get the total number of paths from $E$ to $G$ that pass through $F$? \n6. Can you think of a general formula to calculate the number of paths from one point to another on an $n \\times m$ grid? \n7. What if we were asked to find the number of paths from $E$ to $G$ that do not pass through $F$? How could we approach this problem?"
