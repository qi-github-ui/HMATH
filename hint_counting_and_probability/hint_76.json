    "problem": "Seven people arrive to dinner, but the circular table only seats six.  If two seatings such that one is a rotation of the other are considered the same, then in how many different ways can we choose six people and seat them at the table?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 7 ways to choose the person who is left standing.  To seat the 6 remaining people, there are 6 seats from which the first person can choose, 5 seats left for the second, and so on down to 1 seat for the last person.  This suggests that there are $6\\cdot 5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 6!$ ways to seat the six people.  However, each seating can be rotated six ways, so each seating is counted six times in this count.  Therefore, for each group of 6 people, there are $6!/6 = 5!$ ways to seat them around the table.  There are 7 different possible groups of 6 to seat (one for each person left standing), giving a total of $7\\cdot 5! = \\boxed{840}$ ways to seat the seven people.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem statement asking us to find?\n2. How many people are there in total and how many seats are available at the circular table?\n3. Why is it important to consider the number of seatings that are considered the same?\n4. How many ways are there to choose six people from the seven and seat them at the table?\n5. What is the reasoning behind the formula used to calculate the number of ways to seat the six people without considering rotation?\n6. How many times is each seating counted in this formula, and why is that a problem?\n7. How can we adjust the formula to account for rotational symmetry and avoid double-counting?\n8. How many possible groups of 6 people can be chosen from the 7 people?\n9. What is the final answer to the problem, and how was it obtained?"
