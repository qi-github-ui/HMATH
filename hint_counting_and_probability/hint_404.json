    "problem": "On each of the first three days of January, there is a $\\frac{1}{3}$ chance that it will snow where Bob lives. On each of the next four days, there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that it will snow. What is the probability that it snows at least once during the first week of January?",

    "solution": "On each of the first three days, there is a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance that there will be no snow. On each of the next four days, there is a $\\frac{3}{4}$ chance that there will be no snow. The chance that there will be no snow at all during the first week of January is $\\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) ^3 \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right) ^4=\\frac{3}{32}$. Therefore, the probability that it snows at least once during the first week of January is $1-\\frac{3}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{29}{32}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the event that we are interested in calculating the probability of?\n2. How many days are there in the first week of January that are being considered in this problem?\n3. What are the probabilities of it snowing on the first three days and on the next four days?\n4. How can we calculate the probability of it snowing at least once during the first week of January?\n5. Why do we subtract the probability of no snow from 1 to find the probability of at least one snow day?\n6. Can we use a different method to calculate the probability of it snowing at least once during the first week of January? If so, what would that method be?"
