    "problem": "What is the expected value of the roll of a fair octahedral die? (An octahedral die has 8 faces, numbered from 1 to 8.) Express your answer as a decimal.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Each outcome of rolling an octahedral (8-sided) die has probability $\\frac18$, and the possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.  So the expected value is $$ \\frac18(1) + \\frac18(2) + \\frac18(3) + \\frac18(4) + \\frac18(5) + \\frac18(6)+ \\frac18(7)+ \\frac18(8) = \\frac{36}{8} = \\boxed{4.5}. $$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define the term \"expected value\"? \n2. What does it mean for an event to have a probability? \n3. Can you explain why each outcome of rolling the octahedral die has a probability of $\\frac{1}{8}$? \n4. How would you calculate the expected value in this particular scenario? \n5. Can you describe the process of finding the expected value using the given probabilities and outcomes? \n6. What do you notice about the calculation and the resulting value of the expected value in this case? \n7. Can you think of any other examples where calculating the expected value would be applicable? \n8. How would the method of calculating the expected value change if the probabilities were not equal for each outcome? \n9. What would happen to the expected value if some outcomes had higher probabilities than others? \n10. Can you explain the significance and usefulness of the expected value in real-life situations?"
