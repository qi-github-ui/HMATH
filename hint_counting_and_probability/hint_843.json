    "problem": "A bag contains 3 tan, 2 pink and 4 violet chips. If the 9 chips are randomly drawn from the bag, one at a time and without replacement, what is the probability that the chips are drawn in such a way that the 3 tan chips are drawn consecutively, the 2 pink chips are drawn consecutively, and the 4 violet chips are drawn consecutively, but not necessarily in the tan-pink-violet order? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "We count the number of ways to draw the tan chips consecutively, the pink chips consecutively, and the violet chips consecutively (although not necessarily in that order).  First of all, we can draw the tan chips in $3!$ ways, the pink chips in $2!$ ways, and the violet chips in $4!$ ways.  We can choose our drawing order (e.g pink-tan-violet) in $3!$ ways.  Thus we have $3!2!4!3!$ satisfying arrangements and $9!$ total ways of drawing the chips.  So our answer is $\\frac{3!2!4!3!}{9!} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{210}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the objective of this problem? Can you restate it in your own words?\n2. What are the different colors of chips in the bag and how many chips are there of each color?\n3. How many chips will be drawn in total from the bag?\n4. Can you explain what it means for the tan, pink, and violet chips to be drawn consecutively?\n5. Is the order of drawing the chips important in this problem? Why or why not?\n6. How many ways can the tan chips be drawn consecutively?\n7. How many ways can the pink chips be drawn consecutively?\n8. How many ways can the violet chips be drawn consecutively?\n9. Can you explain why we need to multiply the number of ways to draw each color consecutively?\n10. Can you explain why we multiply all the above numbers together to get the total number of satisfying arrangements?\n11. How many total ways are there to draw the chips in any order?\n12. Can you explain why we divide the number of satisfying arrangements by the total number of ways to draw the chips?\n13. What is the final probability of drawing the chips in the desired way? Express your answer as a fraction."
