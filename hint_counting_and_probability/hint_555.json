    "problem": "Bag A has 3 white marbles and 4 black marbles.  Bag B has 6 yellow marbles and 4 blue marbles.  Bag C has 2 yellow marbles and 5 blue marbles.  A marble is drawn at random from Bag A.  If it is white, a marble is drawn at random from Bag B, otherwise, if it is black, a marble is drawn at random from Bag C.  What is the probability that the second marble drawn is yellow?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We can get the second marble to be yellow in two ways:  either a white from A (with probability 3/7) then a yellow from B (with probability 6/10), or a black from A (with probability 4/7) then a yellow from C (with probability 2/7). Thus, the probability is \\[ \\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\times\\frac{6}{10}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{4}{7}\\times\\frac{2}{7}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{103}{245}}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does Bag A contain? How many white and black marbles are in the bag?\n2. Can you calculate the probability of drawing a white marble from Bag A?\n3. What happens if a white marble is drawn from Bag A? Which bag is chosen for the second draw?\n4. What is the probability of drawing a yellow marble from Bag B?\n5. What happens if a black marble is drawn from Bag A? Which bag is chosen for the second draw?\n6. What is the probability of drawing a yellow marble from Bag C?\n7. How can you calculate the overall probability of drawing a yellow marble as the second marble?\n8. Can you explain why we need to consider the probabilities of drawing a white and black marble from Bag A in our calculation?\n9. Can you think of any other scenarios where we might need to consider multiple probabilities in order to calculate an overall probability?"
