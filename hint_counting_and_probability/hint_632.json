    "problem": "Monica tosses a fair 6-sided die.  If the roll is a prime number, then she wins that amount of dollars (so that, for example, if she rolls 3, then she wins 3 dollars).  If the roll is composite, she wins nothing. Otherwise, she loses 3 dollars. What is the expected value of her winnings on one die toss? Express your answer as a dollar value to the nearest cent.",

    "solution": "The only primes on a die are 2, 3, and 5. The only composites are 4 and 6. The only other option is rolling a 1. There is a $\\dfrac{1}{6}$ probability that she will roll a 1 and lose $\\$3$, a $\\dfrac{1}{3}$ probability of rolling a composite and winning $\\$0$, and a $\\dfrac{1}{6}$ probability of winning each of $\\$2$, $\\$3$, or $\\$5$.  So $$E = \\dfrac{1}{3}\\times \\$0 + \\dfrac{1}{6}\\times(\\$2+\\$3+\\$5) + \\dfrac{1}{6} \\times -\\$3 \\approx \\boxed{\\$1.17}.$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of the expected value in probability?\n2. How can we calculate the expected value in this scenario?\n3. What are the possible outcomes and probabilities of each outcome in this game?\n4. How can we determine the winnings for each outcome?\n5. How can we calculate the expected value using the probabilities and winnings?\n6. What are the probabilities and winnings for each outcome?\n7. How can we multiply the probabilities with the corresponding winnings to calculate the expected value?\n8. What is the resulting expected value? Can we express it as a dollar value to the nearest cent?\n9. Can we interpret the expected value in this context? What does it represent?\n10. Can we compare the expected value to Monica's actual winnings in a single dice toss? What does this comparison tell us?"
