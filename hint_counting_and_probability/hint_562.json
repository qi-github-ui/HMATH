    "problem": "Coach Grunt is preparing the 5-person starting lineup for his basketball team, the Grunters.  There are 12 players on the team.  Two of them, Ace and Zeppo, are league All-Stars, so they'll definitely be in the starting lineup.  How many different starting lineups are possible?  (The order of the players in a basketball lineup doesn't matter.)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Coach Grunt has to choose 3 players from the 10 players that are remaining after Ace and Zeppo have been placed in the lineup.  The order in which the players are chosen doesn't matter, so the answer is $$ \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\boxed{120}. $$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem statement and what do we need to find in this scenario?\n2. How many players are on the team, and how many of them are guaranteed to be in the starting lineup?\n3. Since the order of players in a lineup doesn't matter, should we consider permutations or combinations?\n4. How many players are left to choose from once Ace and Zeppo have been accounted for?\n5. How many players need to be chosen to complete the starting lineup?\n6. What formula can we use to calculate the number of possible combinations for choosing players?\n7. Can you explain how the formula for combinations works in this scenario?\n8. What is the value for ${10\\choose3}$ and how did you calculate it?\n9. Is there any other way to approach this problem using different counting methods? \n10. How would the answer change if Coach Grunt wanted to choose 4 players from the remaining 10 instead of 3?"
