    "problem": "What is the probability that the same number will be facing up on each of three standard six-sided dice that are tossed simultaneously? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The results on the three dice are independent of each other, so we compute the probability for each die and then multiply the probabilities. The first die does not have to be a particular number. There are 6 possible numbers, but any number will work, so the probability is $\\frac{6}{6}=1$. The second die must be the same number as the first die, which is one number out of the 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is $\\frac{1}{6}$. The third die must also be the same number as the first die, so the probability is also $\\frac{1}{6}$. The probability that all three dice will have the same number is then $1\\times\\frac{1}{6}\\times\\frac{1}{6}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{36}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the objective of the problem? Can you restate the problem in your own words?\n2. What is the definition of probability? How can we calculate the probability in this scenario?\n3. Can you describe what it means for events to be independent?\n4. How many possible outcomes are there when one die is rolled? How does this relate to the probability of each outcome?\n5. Why do we multiply the probabilities when the events are independent?\n6. How would you calculate the probability for the first die? How about the second and third dice?\n7. Can you explain why all three dice should have the same number for the desired outcome?\n8. Why is the probability of the first die being any number equal to 1? Can you justify this?\n9. Can you compute the final probability using the probabilities of each die?\n10. Can you think of any other scenarios where the multiplication rule of probability can be applied?"
