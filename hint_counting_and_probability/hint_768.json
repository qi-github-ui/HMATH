    "problem": "If I choose four cards from a standard $52$-card deck, with replacement, what is the probability that I will end up with one card from each suit?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Because we are replacing the cards, at each draw, there is a $\\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4}$ probability of ending up with a card from any given suit. Because we are looking for one card from each of the four suits, it doesn't matter what suit the first card drawn represents. After one card is drawn and replaced, the probability that the second card drawn wil $\\textit{not}$ be from the same suit as the first card is $\\frac{3}{4}$. Similarly, after two cards have been drawn and replaced, the probability that the third card drawn will not be from either of the suits of the first two cards is $\\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Finally, the probability that the fourth card drawn will not be from any of the same suits of the first three cards that were drawn and replaced is $\\frac{1}{4}$. Thus, our final probability is $\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{32}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the probability of drawing one card from each of the four suits in a standard 52-card deck with replacement? \n2. How does the fact that the cards are replaced affect the probability of drawing one card from each suit? \n3. What is the probability of drawing a card from a specific suit on any given draw? \n4. Why does it not matter what suit the first card drawn represents? \n5. How do the probabilities of the second, third, and fourth draws depend on the outcomes of the previous draws? \n6. How does the multiplication principle apply to calculating the overall probability of drawing one card from each suit? \n7. Can this probability be calculated in a different way, such as using combinations or permutations? \n8. How would the answer change if the cards were not replaced after each draw? \n9. Are there any similar problems involving the concept of drawing cards from a deck that can be solved using similar methods?"
