    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The row 1, 1 has 2 numbers.  The row 1, 2, 1 has 3 numbers.  The row 1, 3, 3, 1 has 4 numbers.  Each time we go down one row, we have one more number in the list.  So, the row that starts 1, $k$ has $k+1$ numbers (namely, the numbers $\\binom{k}{0}, \\binom{k}{1}, \\binom{k}{2}, \\ldots, \\binom{k}{k}$.)  So the row with 41 numbers starts $\\binom{40}{0}, \\binom{40}{1}, \\binom{40}{2}, \\ldots$.  The 39th number has two numbers after it, and it is the same as the number in the row with only two numbers before it (that is, the 39th number is the same as the 3rd).  So, the 39th number is $\\binom{40}{2} = \\frac{40\\cdot 39}{2\\cdot 1} = \\boxed{780}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what Pascal's triangle is and how it is constructed?\n2. Why does the number of elements in each row increase by 1 as you move down the triangle?\n3. How can you determine the value of a specific element in Pascal's triangle?\n4. What is the formula for calculating the value of the element in the $n$th row and $k$th column of Pascal's triangle?\n5. How can we apply this knowledge to solve the problem of finding the 39th number in the row of Pascal's triangle with 41 numbers?\n6. Are there any other interesting patterns or properties we can observe in Pascal's triangle?"
