    "solution": "We consider the unordered pairs, or sets, of spins for which the difference of the numbers are greater than or equal to 3, or those games which Jane loses. These can only occur in the sets $\\{1, 4\\}$, $\\{1, 5 \\}$ or $\\{ 2, 5 \\}$. Each of these unordered pairs can occur in 2 orderings (depending on whether Jane or her brother spins each number). So, there are $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ losing combinations out of $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ for Jane. So, her winning probability is $1 - \\frac{6}{25} = \\boxed{\\frac{19}{25}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean for Jane to win in this game? How is the winner determined?\n2. What are the possible outcomes when both Jane and her brother spin the spinner? \n3. How can we determine the difference between their numbers for each outcome?\n4. What is the condition for Jane to win in this game? What does it mean for the non-negative difference to be less than 3?\n5. Can you identify which outcomes would result in Jane winning? Which ones would make her lose?\n6. How can we represent the outcomes where Jane loses using sets or unordered pairs?\n7. According to the given solution, which sets or unordered pairs of spins result in Jane losing? How many are there?\n8. How many total outcomes are there in this game? How many in each set or unordered pair result in Jane losing?\n9. Using the information above, how can we find the probability of Jane winning the game? Can you express it as a common fraction?\n10. Can you think of any other strategies or approaches that could be used to solve this problem?"
