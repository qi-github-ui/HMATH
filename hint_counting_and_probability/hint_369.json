    "problem": "A Senate committee has 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats.  In how many ways can we form a subcommittee with 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 8 Republicans and 3 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ ways to choose the Republicans.  There are 6 Democrats and 2 spots for them, so there are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose the Democrats.  So there are $56 \\times 15 = \\boxed{840}$ ways to choose the subcommittee.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the goal of this problem? Can you restate it in your own words?\n2. How many Republicans and Democrats are there in the original Senate committee? And how many members should the subcommittee have in total?\n3. How many different ways can we choose the 3 Republicans from a group of 8?\n4. Can you explain why the expression $\\binom{8}{3}$ represents the number of ways to choose the 3 Republicans? What does the notation $\\binom{n}{r}$ mean?\n5. What is the value of $\\binom{8}{3}$? How did you calculate it?\n6. Following a similar thought process, how many different ways can we choose the 2 Democrats from a group of 6?\n7. Can you find the value of $\\binom{6}{2}$? How did you calculate it?\n8. In how many ways can we choose the subcommittee by considering both the Republicans and Democrats together?\n9. How can we determine the total number of ways to choose the subcommittee from the previously calculated values of $\\binom{8}{3}$ and $\\binom{6}{2}$?\n10. Can you multiply the values of $\\binom{8}{3}$ and $\\binom{6}{2}$ to find the final answer? What is the result?\n11. Are there any alternative methods you can think of to calculate the total number of ways to choose the subcommittee?"
