    "solution": "First, we count the number of total outcomes.  Each toss has 2 possibilities - heads or tails - so the 7 tosses have $2^7 = 128$ possible outcomes.\n\nTo count the number of outcomes with at least 5 heads, we need to use casework.\n\nCase 1: 5 heads. To count the number of ways that 5 heads can come up, we simply need to choose 5 of the 7 tosses to be heads (the other 2 tosses will then automatically be tails).  So this can be done in $\\binom{7}{5} = 21$ ways.\n\nCase 2: 6 heads. Here we have to choose 6 of the tosses to be heads; this can be done in $\\binom{7}{6} = 7$ ways.\n\nCase 3: 7 heads. There's only 1 way to do this -- all 7 tosses must be heads.\n\nSo there are $21 + 7 + 1 = 29$ successful outcomes, hence the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{29}{128}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain why we need to count the total number of outcomes before discussing the probability of at least 5 heads?\n2. How many possibilities are there for each individual coin toss?\n3. How did we determine that the 7 coin tosses have $2^7 = 128$ possible outcomes?\n4. In case 1, why do we choose 5 of the 7 tosses to be heads?\n5. How did we calculate $\\binom{7}{5}$ to be 21?\n6. Can you explain why in case 2, we have to choose 6 of the tosses to be heads?\n7. Can you determine how many successful outcomes there are in case 2?\n8. Why is there only 1 way to achieve case 3 with 7 heads?\n9. Could you provide an alternative method for calculating the total number of successful outcomes?\n10. Can you explain how we calculated the final probability to be $\\frac{29}{128}$ in this scenario?\n11. Can you think of any other scenarios where casework may be required when calculating probabilities?"
