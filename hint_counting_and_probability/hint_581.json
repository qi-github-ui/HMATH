    "problem": "The inhabitants of the island of Jumble use the standard Kobish alphabet ($20$ letters, A through T).  Each word in their language is $4$ letters or less, and for some reason, they insist that all words contain the letter A at least once. How many words are possible?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We consider the opposite; we try to find the number of words that do not contain A, and then subtract it from the total possible number of words. So we have a few cases to consider:\n\n$\\bullet$  One letter words: There is only $1$ one-letter word that contains A, that's A.\n\n$\\bullet$  Two letter words: There are $19\\times19=361$ words that do not contain A. There is a total of $20\\times20=400$ words, so we have $400-361=39$ words that satisfy the condition.\n\n$\\bullet$  Three letter words: There are $19\\times19\\times19=6859$ words without A, and there are $20^{3}=8000$ words available. So there are $8000-6859=1141$ words that satisfy the condition.\n\n$\\bullet$  Four letter words: Using the same idea as above, we have $20^{4}-19^{4}=29679$ words satisfying the requirement.\n\nSo this gives a total of $1+39+1141+29679=\\boxed{30860}$ words.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you restate the problem in your own words? What are the constraints and requirements?\n2. How can we approach this problem? Can we use a similar strategy of considering the opposite, like in the example provided?\n3. Let's start with one-letter words. How many words are possible and how many of them contain the letter A?\n4. Moving on to two-letter words, what is the total number of words and the number of words without the letter A?\n5. Using the same approach, what are the numbers of three-letter and four-letter words without the letter A?\n6. How can we then find the total number of words that satisfy the given condition?\n7. Can you summarize your findings and provide the final answer to the problem?"
