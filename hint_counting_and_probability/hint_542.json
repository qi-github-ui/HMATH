    "problem": "A box contains 4 white balls and 4 black balls.  I draw them out of the box, one at a time.  What is the probability that all of my draws alternate colors?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Let $B$ denote drawing a black ball and $W$ denote drawing a white ball.\n\nThere are two possible successful orders: $BWBWBWBW$ or $WBWBWBWB.$\n\nThere are $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$ ways to arrange four $B$'s and four $W$'s, so the probability that a random arrangement is successful is $\\dfrac{2}{70} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{35}}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe could also compute this based on the probabilities at each step that we draw a ball of the opposite color.  If we do that, we get $\\frac47 \\times \\frac36 \\times \\frac35 \\times \\frac24 \\times \\frac23 \\times \\frac12 = \\frac{144}{5040} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{35}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the scenario described in the problem?\n2. What are the possible outcomes when drawing the balls one at a time?\n3. How many possible arrangements are there in total?\n4. Can you explain the concept of alternating colors in this context?\n5. How many successful arrangements result in alternating colors?\n6. What is the probability of a random arrangement being successful?\n7. Can you explain the reasoning behind the two different methods of calculating the probability?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios where the concept of alternating colors comes into play in probability calculations?"
