    "problem": "A fair 6-sided die is rolled.  If the roll is even, then you win that amount of dollars (so that, for example, if you roll 4, then you win $\\$4$).  If the roll is odd, you win nothing.  What is the expected value of your winnings? Express your answer as a dollar value.",

    "solution": "There is a $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ probability of rolling an odd number and winning $\\$0$, and a $\\dfrac{1}{6}$ probability of winning each of $\\$2$, $\\$4$, or $\\$6$.  So $E = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\times \\$0 + \\dfrac{1}{6}\\times(\\$2+\\$4+\\$6) = \\boxed{\\$2}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean to calculate the expected value of the winnings?\n2. How can we determine the probability of rolling an odd number?\n3. What are the possible outcomes and respective probabilities for winning $\\$2$, $\\$4$, and $\\$6$?\n4. How do we calculate the expected value when there are different outcomes with different probabilities?\n5. Why do we multiply each outcome by its probability?\n6. Can you explain why we add the products of each outcome and its probability to find the expected value?\n7. Is there a possibility of losing money in this scenario? If so, how would that impact the calculations?\n8. What would happen to the expected value if the probabilities or winnings were different?\n9. Can you think of any other scenarios where calculating expected value would be useful?"
