    "problem": "Three friends have a total of 6 identical pencils, and each one has at least one pencil. In how many ways can this happen?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The largest number of pencils that any friend can have is four. There are 3 ways that this can happen: $(4,1,1)$, $(1,4,1)$ and $(1,1,4)$. There are 6 ways one person can have 3 pencils: $(3,2,1)$, $(3,1,2)$, $(2,3,1)$, $(2,1,3)$, $(1,2,3)$ and $(1,3,2)$. There is only one way all three can have two pencils each: $(2,2,2)$. The total number of possibilities is $3+6+1=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem we are trying to solve in this scenario? \n2. What is the minimum number of pencils each friend must have, and why is that important? \n3. What is the maximum number of pencils any friend can have, and why does that limit our possibilities? \n4. Can you walk me through the three different ways that three friends could each have four, one, and one pencils? \n5. How did you arrive at the six ways that one person could have three pencils? \n6. Can you explain why there is only one way for all three friends to have two pencils each? \n7. How are we keeping track of the total number of possibilities? \n8. Are there any other restrictions we need to consider in this problem? \n9. Can you think of any similar scenarios where we would use counting and probability techniques to solve a problem? \n10. How does understanding these techniques help us in real-life situations?"
