    "problem": "In a press conference before the All-Star Game, eight All-Stars will be taking questions. Three are Cubs, three are Red Sox, and two are Yankees. If teammates insist on sitting together, how many ways can the eight All-Stars be seated in a row?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We first think of the Cubs forming a single block, denoted C, the Red Sox forming a single block R, and the Yankees forming a single block Y.  Then there are $3! = 6$ ways to arrange the three blocks in a row: $$ \\text{\\textbf{\\large CRY, CYR, RCY, RYC, YRC, YCR}.} $$Within each block, there are $3!$ ways to arrange the Cubs, $3!$ ways to arrange the Red Sox, and $2!$ ways to arrange the Yankees.  Therefore, there are $$ 3! \\times 3! \\times 3! \\times 2! = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 2 = \\boxed{432} $$ways to seat all eight All-Stars.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the problem is asking for? \n2. How many All-Stars are there in total and how are they divided among the Cubs, Red Sox, and Yankees? \n3. What does it mean when teammates insist on sitting together? \n4. How can we simplify the problem by grouping the Cubs, Red Sox, and Yankees together? \n5. How many ways are there to arrange the three blocks of teams in a row? \n6. How many ways are there to arrange the All-Stars within each block? \n7. Can you multiply the number of ways to arrange the teams and the number of ways to arrange the All-Stars within each team to get the final answer? \n8. What is the final result and does it make sense given the problem? \n9. Can you think of a similar problem that involves arranging people or objects according to certain conditions? \n10. How important is it to consider the groupings and conditions given in a probability problem when calculating the total number of outcomes?"
