    "solution": "We have two cases because if the first card is a King, it could be a $\\heartsuit$ or not be a $\\heartsuit$.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the King of $\\heartsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{12}{51} = \\dfrac{4}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the twelve remaining $\\heartsuit$, which gives a probability of $\\dfrac{1}{52} \\times \\dfrac{4}{17} = \\dfrac{1}{221}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nThere is a $\\dfrac{3}{52}$ chance that a non-$\\heartsuit$ King is drawn first, and a $\\dfrac{13}{51}$ chance that a $\\heartsuit$ is drawn second, giving a $\\dfrac{3}{52} \\times \\dfrac{13}{51} = \\dfrac{1}{68}$ chance that this occurs.\n\nSo the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\\dfrac{1}{221} + \\dfrac{1}{68} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of possible outcomes when two cards are dealt from a standard deck of 52 cards?\n2. Out of the 52 cards, how many of them are kings? And how many of those kings are of the $\\heartsuit$ suit?\n3. What is the probability of drawing a King as the first card?\n4. If the first card drawn is a King, what is the probability of drawing a $\\heartsuit$ as the second card?\n5. What is the probability of drawing a non-$\\heartsuit$ King as the first card?\n6. If a non-$\\heartsuit$ King is drawn first, what is the probability of drawing a $\\heartsuit$ as the second card?\n7. Can we combine the probabilities from cases 4 and 6 to find the overall probability of the first card being a King and the second card being a $\\heartsuit$?"
