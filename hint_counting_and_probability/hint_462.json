    "problem": "Five standard six-sided dice are rolled.  We are told there is no three-of-a-kind, but there is a pair of dice that show the same number.  These two dice are set aside, and the other three dice are re-rolled.  What is the probability that after re-rolling these three dice, at least three of the five dice show the same value?",

    "solution": "There are a total of $6^3=216$ possible sets of dice rolls. If at least one of the re-rolled dice matches the pair we set aside, we will have at least three dice showing the same value. But we will also have three dice showing the same value if all three re-rolled dice come up the same.\n\nConsider the first case. There are five ways for each of the three dice NOT to match the pair, so there are $5^3=125$ ways for NONE of the three dice to match the pair, so there are $216-125=91$ ways for at least one of the three dice to match the pair.\n\nIn the second case, we need all three dice to match each other. There are $6$ ways to pick which value the three dice will have.\n\nBut we have overcounted by $1;$ both of the above cases include the outcome where all five dice match. So there are $91+6-1 = 96$ ways to have at least three dice match. So, the probability is $$\\frac{\\text{successful outcomes}}{\\text{total outcomes}}=\\frac{96}{216}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}.$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you restate the problem in your own words? \n2. What information do we know from the problem? Can you summarize it?\n3. What is the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice? \n4. How can we approach the problem by considering the outcomes where at least three dice show the same value?\n5. Let's focus on the first case - when at least one of the three re-rolled dice matches the pair. How many ways are there for none of the three dice to match the pair?\n6. How can we calculate the number of ways for at least one of the three dice to match the pair?\n7. Now, let's consider the second case - when all three re-rolled dice match each other. How many ways are there to select the value for these three dice?\n8. Have we counted all the possible outcomes correctly, or have we overcounted in any way? Can you explain?\n9. What is the final number of ways to have at least three dice match after re-rolling? \n10. What is the probability of having at least three dice show the same value after re-rolling? "
