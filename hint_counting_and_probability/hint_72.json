    "problem": "There are 5 blue chips, 4 red chips and 3 yellow chips in a bag. One chip is drawn from the bag. That chip is placed back into the bag, and a second chip is drawn. What is the probability that the two selected chips are of different colors? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "If the first chip drawn is blue, there is a probability of 7/12 of drawing a chip which isn't blue second. If the first chip drawn is red, there is a probability of 8/12 of drawing a chip which isn't red second. And if the first chip is yellow, there is a 9/12 probability of drawing a chip which isn't yellow second. So, the probability that the two selected chips are different colors is $\\frac{5}{12}\\cdot\\frac{7}{12} + \\frac{4}{12}\\cdot\\frac{8}{12} + \\frac{3}{12}\\cdot\\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{(35+32+27)}{144} = \\frac{94}{144} = \\boxed{\\frac{47}{72}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem we are trying to solve, and what information do we have?\n2. What are the possible outcomes for the first chip drawn, and what is the probability of each outcome?\n3. If the first chip drawn is blue, what are the possible outcomes for the second chip drawn, and what is the probability of each outcome?\n4. What are the corresponding probabilities for the second chip if the first chip drawn is red or yellow?\n5. How can we calculate the overall probability of drawing two chips of different colors?\n6. Can we double-check our answer using a different method or approach?\n7. How would the probabilities change if the chips were not replaced after each draw?"
