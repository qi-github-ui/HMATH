As the diagram below illustrates, these are all the points in the square except those in the triangle with vertices (2,1), (2,2), and (1,2).\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(.7);\n\ndraw((-.1,0)--(3,0),Arrow);\ndraw((0,-.1)--(0,4),Arrow);\n\ndraw((0,2)--(2,2)--(2,0));\ndraw((-.5,3.5)--(2.5,.5),dashed,Arrows);\n\nfill((0,0)--(0,2)--(1,2)--(2,1)--(2,0)--cycle,gray(.7));\n\nlabel(\"(1,2)\",(1,2),NE);\nlabel(\"(2,2)\",(2,2),NE);\nlabel(\"(2,1)\",(2,1),NE);\n[/asy]\n\nSince this is a right triangle whose sides both of length 1, its area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1^2 = 1/2$.  Since the square in question has side length 2, its area is $2^2 = 4$, so the shaded region has area $4 - 1/2 = 7/2$.  Our probability is therefore $\\dfrac{7/2}{4} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{8}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given scenario and what are we trying to find?\n2. Can you interpret the condition $x+y < 3$ geometrically? How does it relate to the square and the line $y = -x + 3$?\n3. Why are we interested in the points below the line $y = -x + 3$? What do these points represent in terms of the given condition?\n4. Can you visualize and describe the shaded region in the diagram? What is the area of this shaded region?\n5. What is the total area of the square and how can we find it?\n6. How can we determine the probability of choosing a point that satisfies $x+y < 3$?"
