    "problem": "Ben throws four identical darts. Each hits one of four identical dartboards on the wall. After throwing the four darts, he lists the number of darts that hit each board, from greatest to least.  How many different lists are possible?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The ways to arrange identical darts on identical dartboards only depends on the number of darts on each board.  The ways to do this are $(4,0,0,0)$, $(3,1,0,0)$, $(2,2,0,0)$, $(2,1,1,0)$, $(1,1,1,1)$.  There are $\\boxed{5}$ ways.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you summarize the problem statement in your own words?\n2. Can you identify the key information in the problem?\n3. What do you understand by \"identical darts\" and \"identical dartboards\"?\n4. How many darts are thrown in total?\n5. How many dartboards are there?\n6. Can you identify any constraints or limitations in the problem?\n7. How can we approach this problem? Can you think of any strategies?\n8. What does it mean by \"listing the number of darts that hit each board, from greatest to least\"?\n9. Can you break down the problem into simpler parts?\n10. How many combinations are possible when all darts hit a single board?\n11. How many combinations are possible when three darts hit one board and one dart hits another?\n12. Can you find all the possible combinations for different numbers of darts hitting each board?\n13. How many different lists can be formed based on the combinations we found?\n14. Do you think there is a formula or pattern that can help us find the total number of different lists?"
