    "problem": "A club has $5$ members from each of $3$ different schools, for a total of $15$ members. How many possible ways are there to arrange a presidency meeting under the following conditions:\n\ni. The club must choose one of the $3$ schools at which to host the meeting, and\n\nii. The host school sends $2$ representatives to the meeting, and each of the other two schools sends $1$ representative.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Pick one of the schools as the host. There are $\\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ ways to select the two representatives from that school and $\\dbinom{5}{1}$ ways to pick a representative from each of the other schools. So once we have selected a host school, there are $10\\times5\\times5=250$ ways to pick the representatives. However, any of the three schools can be the host, so we need to multiply $250$ by $3$ to get $\\boxed{750}$ ways.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many members are there in total in the club?\n2. How many schools are there in the club?\n3. What does it mean for a school to host the meeting?\n4. How many representatives does the host school send to the meeting?\n5. How many representatives do the other two schools send to the meeting?\n6. How many ways are there to choose the two representatives from the host school?\n7. How many ways are there to choose a representative from each of the other two schools?\n8. Once the representatives have been selected, how many ways are there to arrange the meeting?\n9. Can any of the three schools be the host? Why or why not?\n10. How can we calculate the total number of ways to arrange the meeting under the given conditions?"
