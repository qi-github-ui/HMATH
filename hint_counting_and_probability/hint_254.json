    "solution": "There are $\\binom{10}{3}=120$ ways to select exactly three dice to roll 1's ones out of ten dice total. The probability of any one of these outcomes occurring is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{5}{6}\\right)^7$ and they're all mutually exclusive cases, so the probability that one of them will occur (which is the probability that we're looking for) is $\\binom{10}{3}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{5}{6}\\right)^7=\\dfrac{120\\cdot5^7\\cdot1^3}{6^{10}}\\approx \\boxed{.155}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define probability in the context of this problem?\n2. What is the total number of possible outcomes when ten 6-sided dice are rolled?\n3. How many ways are there to choose exactly three dice to show a 1 out of ten dice?\n4. Can you explain why each selected dice showing a 1 has a probability of $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^3$?\n5. Why is the probability of the remaining seven dice not showing a 1 $\\left(\\dfrac{5}{6}\\right)^7$?\n6. Are all the outcomes of the three selected dice and the remaining seven dice mutually exclusive?\n7. How do we calculate the total probability of exactly three dice showing a 1 using the previously discussed probabilities and combinations?\n8. Can you simplify the expression $\\dfrac{120\\cdot5^7\\cdot1^3}{6^{10}}$ and round it to the nearest thousandth?"
