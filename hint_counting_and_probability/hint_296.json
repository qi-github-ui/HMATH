    "problem": "How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 2 boxes if the balls are distinguishable but the boxes are not?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since the boxes are indistinguishable, there are 3 possibilities for arrangements of the number of balls in each box.\n\nCase 1: 5 balls in one box, 0 in the other box. We must choose 5 balls to go in one box, which can be done in $\\binom{5}{5} = 1$ way.\n\nCase 2: 4 balls in one box, 1 in the other box. We must choose 4 balls to go in one box, which can be done in  $\\binom{5}{4} = 5$ ways.\n\nCase 3: 3 balls in one box, 2 in the other box. We must choose 3 balls to go in one box, which can be done in $\\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways.\n\nThis gives us a total of $1 + 5 + 10 = \\boxed{16}$ arrangements.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many boxes are there in total for us to place the 5 balls?\n2. Are the balls distinguishable or indistinguishable from each other?\n3. Are the boxes distinguishable or indistinguishable from each other?\n4. Since the balls are distinguishable, what are the possible arrangements for Case 1?\n5. How many ways can we select the balls to be placed in one box for Case 1?\n6. How many ways can we select the balls to be placed in one box for Case 2?\n7. How many ways can we select the balls to be placed in one box for Case 3?\n8. Can you explain the reasoning behind the formula used to calculate the number of ways to choose a specific number of items from a larger set?\n9. Can you think of any other situations where similar counting principles would be applicable?\n10. Lastly, what is the final answer to the question: \"How many ways are there to put 5 balls in 2 boxes if the balls are distinguishable but the boxes are not?\""
