    "problem": "Alex has 5 pieces of paper, each with a different math problem. In how many ways can he give these problems to his 10 friends (he can give each friend more than one problem)?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "For each of Alex's five problems, there are 10 friends he can give it to. Therefore, there are $10^5=\\boxed{100,\\!000}$ ways for Alex to distribute the problems.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find? \n2. What is the total number of papers Alex has? \n3. How many friends does Alex have? \n4. How many options does Alex have for his first paper, given that he can give it to any of his 10 friends? \n5. What is the total number of options for Alex's second paper, given that he can give it to any of his 10 friends? \n6. What is the total number of options for Alex's third paper? \n7. What is the total number of options for Alex's fourth paper? \n8. What is the total number of options for Alex's fifth paper? \n9. How do we combine the number of options for each paper to find the total number of ways Alex can distribute the problems to his friends? \n10. Can you apply this same method to a similar but slightly different problem, such as if Alex had 6 papers and only 8 friends to give them to?"
