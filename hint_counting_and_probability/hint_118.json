    "solution": "At least one of the dice must come up 6, since otherwise the best we can do is 15.  The other two dice must add up to 10.  There are two ways two dice add to 10: $4+6$ and $5+5$.\n\nSo, we have two cases to consider:\n\nA) The dice are 6, 6, 4.  There are three possible ways this can happen, and the probability of each is $(1/6)^3 = 1/216$.  So, the probability of this case is $3(1/216) = 1/72$.\n\n\nB) The dice are 6, 5, 5.  There are three possible ways this can happen, and the probability of each is $(1/6)^3 = 1/216$.  So, the probability of this case is $3(1/216) = 1/72$.\n\nAdding the probabilities of these two cases gives us a total probability of $\\frac{1}{72} + \\frac{1}{72} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{36}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find?\n2. Are there any constraints or restrictions on the dice rolls?\n3. How many different ways can we roll three dice?\n4. How many ways can we get a sum of 16 using three dice?\n5. What is the probability of rolling a single 6 on a single die? How does this relate to the problem?\n6. How many ways can we get two dice to add up to 10? \n7. What are the two cases we need to consider in order to get a sum of 16 with three dice?\n8. What is the probability of each of the two cases?\n9. How do we calculate the overall probability of getting a sum of 16 with three dice?\n10. Are there any other similar dice probability problems we can think of, and how would we approach solving them?"
