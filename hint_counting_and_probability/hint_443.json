    "problem": "Phil has 7 green marbles and 3 purple marbles in a bag. He removes a marble at random, records the color, puts it back, and then repeats this process until he has withdrawn 6 marbles. What is the probability that exactly three of the marbles that he removes are green? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest thousandth.",

    "solution": "There is a $\\left( \\frac{7}{10} \\right) ^3 \\left( \\frac{3}{10} \\right) ^3 = \\frac{9261}{1000000}$ probability that 3 particular marbles out of 6 will be green and the rest will be purple. There are also  $\\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose which 3 out of the 6 are the green ones. Because these ways are all mutually exclusive, we multiply to get the probability that we're looking for: $20 \\cdot \\frac{9261}{1000000}\\approx \\boxed{.185}$.",

What is the total number of ways to choose 3 marbles out of the 10 marbles in the bag?\n10. Why do we use the combination formula to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 out of 6 marbles to be green?\n11. Why do we multiply the probability of pulling out 3 green marbles by the number of ways to choose 3 out of 6 marbles to be green?\n12. What is the final probability of exactly 3 out of 6 marbles being green?"
