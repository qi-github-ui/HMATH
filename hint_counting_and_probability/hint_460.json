    "problem": "If six people decide to come to a basketball game, but three of them are only 2/5 sure that they will stay for the entire time (the other three are sure they'll stay the whole time), what is the probability that at the end, at least 5 people stayed the entire time?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are two cases: 5 people and 6 people stayed.\n\nCase 1: 5 people stayed the whole time.  The probability that exactly 2 of those that are unsure stayed the entire time is $\\binom{3}{2}\\times \\frac{2}{5}\\times\\frac{2}{5}\\times\\frac{3}{5}= 36/125$.\n\nCase 2: 6 people stayed the whole time.  The probability that all three unsure people stayed is $(2/5)^3 = 8/125$.\n\nThe sum of these probabilities is $\\boxed{\\frac{44}{125}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the scenario presented in the problem? \n2. What is the probability that someone who is not sure if they will stay the whole time actually stays the whole time? \n3. How many different ways can we choose 5 or 6 people to stay the whole time? \n4. Can you calculate the probability that exactly 1 person who is unsure stays the whole time? \n5. How does the probability change if we require that all six people stay the whole time? \n6. Can you think of similar scenarios where probability calculations are relevant?"
