What is the total number of toothpicks used in the 15th stage?\n4. Can you explain the pattern of adding toothpicks to each stage? Why is it important to add 2 toothpicks in each stage?\n5. Are there any other patterns or sequences that can help us determine the number of toothpicks used in each stage?\n6. Is there a mathematical formula or equation that can be used to calculate the total number of toothpicks used in any given stage?\n7. How can you check if your answer for the 15th stage is correct?\n8. Can you generalize the relationship between the stage number and the number of toothpicks used?\n9. How would the pattern change if we added more toothpicks in each stage? Can you predict the number of toothpicks in the 15th stage in that case?"
