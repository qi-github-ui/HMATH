    "problem": "In how many ways can 7 people be seated in a row of chairs if two of the people, Wilma and Paul, refuse to sit next to each other?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The number of all seating arrangements is $7!$. The number of seating arrangements in which Wilma and Paul sit next to each other is $6!\\times 2!$. (We can arrive at $6!\\times 2!$ by pretending Wilma and Paul together are one person, WilmaPaul, and that we have 6 chairs.  We then have 6 people, who we can seat in $6!$ ways.  We then must break WilmaPaul back into two people, which we can do in $2!$ ways, one for each order of the two -- Wilma then Paul, and Paul then Wilma.  That gives us a total of $6!\\times 2!$ ways to arrange the people with Wilma and Paul together.)  Thus the number of acceptable arrangements is $7!-6!\\times 2!=\\boxed{3600}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of possible seating arrangements for 7 people in a row of chairs?\n2. Why can't Wilma and Paul sit next to each other? \n3. How can we arrive at the number of seating arrangements in which Wilma and Paul sit next to each other?\n4. How do we arrive at the number of acceptable arrangements using the subtraction principle? \n5. Are there any other methods to solve this problem besides using the subtraction principle? \n6. If there were more than 2 people who refused to sit together, would the same method work? \n7. How does the answer change if the chairs are arranged in a circle instead of a row? \n8. Can the same method be applied if there are more than 7 people?"
