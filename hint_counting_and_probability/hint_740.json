    "solution": "Call a triangle with side length 1 toothpick a 1-triangle. The figure contains 10 upward-pointing 1-triangles and 6 downward-pointing 1-triangles. Removing a toothpick destroys at most one upward-pointing 1-triangle, so we must remove at least 10 toothpicks. Any triangle must have at least one horizontal toothpick, so if we remove all $\\boxed{10}$ horizontal toothpicks, no triangles remain. Since we have to remove at least 10, this is the minimum.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many toothpicks are used to create the figure?\n2. How many 1-triangles are there in the figure?\n3. How many upward-pointing 1-triangles are there? How about downward-pointing 1-triangles?\n4. How many toothpicks are needed to create a 1-triangle?\n5. If we remove a toothpick, how many upward-pointing 1-triangles can be destroyed at most?\n6. What is the minimum number of toothpicks that need to be removed so that no triangles remain?\n7. Can we remove only upward-pointing triangles to achieve the minimum number of removals? Why or why not?\n8. How many horizontal toothpicks are there in the figure?\n9. Why do we need to have at least one horizontal toothpick in any triangle?\n10. If we remove all the horizontal toothpicks, how many triangles will remain?"
