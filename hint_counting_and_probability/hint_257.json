    "problem": "Steve guesses randomly on a 15-question multiple choice test in which each problem has two choices, a correct one and an incorrect one. What is the probability that he gets at least half of the questions correct? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Steve cannot get exactly half the questions right since there are an odd number of questions. So he can get either more than half or less than half correct, with equal probability, since he has a $1/2$ chance of getting any individual question correct. This means that Steve has a probability of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ of getting more than half correct, or identically, at least half correct.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of possible outcomes for Steve's guesses on the 15-question test?\n2. How many questions does Steve need to get correct in order to have at least half of them correct?\n3. What is the probability of getting exactly half of the questions correct?\n4. How many different combinations of correct and incorrect answers are there that result in Steve getting more than half of the questions correct?\n5. Can you calculate the probability of getting more than half of the questions correct using the combinations calculated in the previous question?\n6. Are there any other methods or strategies that Steve can use to improve his chances of getting at least half of the questions correct?\n7. Is the probability of getting more than half of the questions correct the same as the probability of getting less than half correct? Why or why not?"
