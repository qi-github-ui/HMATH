    "problem": "Given that $\\binom{17}{10}=19448$, $\\binom{17}{11}=12376$ and $\\binom{19}{12}=50388$, find $\\binom{18}{12}$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We know that $\\binom{19}{12}=\\binom{18}{11}+\\binom{18}{12}$ from Pascal's identity. Solving for $\\binom{18}{12}$ and substituting the value that we have for $\\binom{19}{12}$ gives us $\\binom{18}{12}=50388-\\binom{18}{11}$. Once again using Pascal's identity, we know that $\\binom{18}{11}=\\binom{17}{11}+\\binom{17}{10}$. Substituting the values that we have for the terms on the right side gives us $\\binom{18}{11}=31824$ and substituting that into our expression for $\\binom{18}{12}$ gives us $\\binom{18}{12}=50388-31824=\\boxed{18564}$.",
