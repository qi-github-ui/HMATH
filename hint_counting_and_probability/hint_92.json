    "problem": "Consider the dark square in an array of unit squares, part of which is shown. The first ring of squares around this center square contains 8 unit squares. The second ring contains 16 unit squares. If we continue this process, then what is the number of unit squares in the $100^{th}$ ring?\n\n[asy]\nfill((2,2)--(7,2)--(7,7)--(2,7)--cycle,gray(0.8));\nfill((3,3)--(6,3)--(6,6)--(3,6)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill((4,4)--(4,5)--(5,5)--(5,4)--cycle,black);\nfor (int i=0; i<10; ++i) {\ndraw((0,i)--(9,i));\ndraw((i,0)--(i,9));\n}\n[/asy]",

    "solution": "The $n^{th}$ ring can be partitioned into four rectangles: two containing $2n+1$ unit squares and two containing $2n-1$ unit squares. So there are $$2(2n+1)+2(2n-1) = 8n$$ unit squares in the $n^{th}$ ring. Thus, the $100^{th}$ ring has $8 \\cdot 100 = \\boxed{800}$ unit squares.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the problem is asking for?\n2. How can we determine the number of unit squares in each ring?\n3. What is the pattern or formula that we can use to find the number of unit squares in each ring?\n4. How can we prove that the formula we derived is correct for any value of n?\n5. Is there any other way to approach this problem besides using the formula? How do the different methods compare in terms of efficiency and accuracy?\n6. Can we generalize this problem to other shapes besides squares? What would be the challenges and considerations in doing so?"
