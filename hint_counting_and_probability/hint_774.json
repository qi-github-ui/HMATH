    "problem": "Two cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that the first card is a heart and the second card is a 10?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are two cases.\n\nCase 1: The first card is a $\\heartsuit$ but not a 10.\n\nThe probability of the first card satisfying this is $\\dfrac{12}{52},$ and then the probability that the second card is a 10 is $\\dfrac{4}{51}.$\n\nCase 2: The first card is the 10 $\\heartsuit$.\n\nThe probability of the first card being the 10 $\\heartsuit$ is $\\dfrac{1}{52},$ and then the probability that the second card is a 10 is $\\dfrac{3}{51}.$\n\nWe then add the probability of the two cases (since they are exclusive) to get \\[\\frac{12}{52}\\times \\frac{4}{51}+\\frac{1}{52}\\times \\frac{3}{51}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{52}}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find the probability of?\n2. How many cards are in a standard 52-card deck? What is the probability of drawing a heart as the first card?\n3. Why do we need to consider the two different cases in this problem?\n4. What is the probability of drawing a 10 as the second card given that the first card is a heart but not a 10?\n5. What is the probability of drawing a 10 as the second card given that the first card is the 10 of hearts?\n6. Why do we multiply the probabilities in each case to get the overall probability of the desired outcome?\n7. Are there any other similar problems that can be solved using a similar approach? Can you think of any variations to this problem?"
