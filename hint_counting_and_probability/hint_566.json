    "solution": "First, we count the number of total outcomes. Each toss has $2$ possibilities - heads or tails - so the $7$ tosses have $2^7 = 128$ possible outcomes.\n\nTo count the number of outcomes with at least $5$ consecutive heads, we need to use casework.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 1: Exactly $5$ heads. There are three positions for a string of $5$ heads in a row, so there are $3$ possibilities in this case.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 2: Exactly $6$ heads in a row. There are two positions for a string of $6$ heads in a row, so there are $2$ possibilities in this case.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 3: Exactly $6$ heads, but not six in a row. There are two possibilities: either the first five coins and the last coin are heads, or the last five coins and the first coin are heads.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 4: $7$ heads. There's only $1$ way to do this -- all $7$ tosses must be heads.\n\nSo there are $3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8$ successful outcomes, hence the probability is $\\frac{8}{128}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the possible outcomes of flipping a fair coin once?\n2. How many total outcomes are possible when flipping a fair coin seven times?\n3. What is the probability that the first flip is heads?\n4. How many different ways can you get a string of five consecutive heads in seven coin flips?\n5. Which cases did we consider when counting the number of outcomes with at least five consecutive heads?\n6. What is the total number of successful outcomes in all the cases we considered?\n7. How do we use the total number of outcomes and the number of successful outcomes to calculate the probability of getting at least five consecutive heads in seven flips of a fair coin?"
