    "solution": "We first count the total number of three-digit integers we can construct.  Since each digit can occur in each of the three spins, there are $3^3 = 27$ possible integers.  Since we are only looking for numbers that are divisible by 4, we know the units digit must be even.  In this case, the only possibility for an even units digit is 2.  The divisibility rule for 4 is any number in which the last two digits are divisible by 4 - in this case, 12 and 32.  The hundreds digit doesn't matter.  There are 6 possibilities, 112, 132, 212, 232, 312, and 332.  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{6}{27}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{9}}$.",
