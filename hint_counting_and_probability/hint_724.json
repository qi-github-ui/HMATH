    "problem": "There are 3 math teams in the area, with 5, 7, and 8 students respectively. Each team has two co-captains. If I randomly select a team, and then randomly select two members of that team to give a copy of $\\emph{Introduction to Geometry}$, what is the probability that both of the people who receive books are co-captains?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There's a $\\dfrac{1}{3}$ chance that I will select each team. Once I have selected a team, let $n$ be the number of students on that team. There are $\\dbinom{n}{2}$ ways to choose a pair of those students to give books to, but only one of those pairs will be the two co-captains, which means that once I have selected that team, the probability that I give books to the co-captains is $$\\dfrac{1}{\\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}}=\\dfrac{2}{n(n-1)}.$$Since the teams have $5,$ $7,$ and $8$ students, this means that the total probability is $$\\dfrac{1}{3}\\left(\\dfrac{2}{5(5-1)}+\\dfrac{2}{7(7-1)}+\\dfrac{2}{8(8-1)}\\right)$$which after a bit of arithmetic simplifies to $\\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{180}}$.",

How many co-captains does each team have?\n4. If you randomly select a team, what is the probability of selecting each team?\n5. Once you have selected a team, how many different pairs of students can you choose to give books to?\n6. Out of all the possible pairs, how many of them consist of the two co-captains?\n7. Once you have selected a team, what is the probability of giving books to the co-captains?\n8. How can we express the probability of selecting a team, selecting two co-captains, and then giving books to them?\n9. How can we calculate the probability for each team and then combine them?\n10. What is the final probability that both people who receive books are co-captains?"
