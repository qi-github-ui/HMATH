    "problem": "How many odd numbers between $100$ and $999$ have distinct digits?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The fact that the number is odd means that the last digit can only be a $1$, $3$, $5$, $7$, or $9$. So there are $5$ choices for the units digit. There are nine potential choices for the hundreds-place digit ($1$, $2$, $\\ldots$ , $9$), but we know that we've used one of these numbers for the units digit, so, since our digits must be distinct, we subtract one off for $8$ total choices for the hundreds digit. Finally, the tens-place digit can be anything from $0$ to $9$, minus the two digits we've used already, leaving $8$ choices for the tens digit. Thus, there are $5\\cdot 8 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{320}$ such numbers.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many choices are there for the units digit of the odd number?\n2. How many potential choices are there for the hundreds-place digit? And why do we subtract one off?\n3. What are the possible choices for the tens-place digit? And why do we subtract two off?\n4. What is the total number of odd numbers with distinct digits between $100$ and $999$?\n5. Can you explain the reasoning behind multiplying the number of choices for each digit to get the total count?\n6. Are there any other restrictions or considerations that we should take into account when counting these numbers?"
