    "problem": "Define a $\\it{good\\ word}$ as a sequence of letters that consists only of the letters $A$, $B$, and $C$ --- some of these letters may not appear in the sequence --- and in which $A$ is never immediately followed by $B$, $B$ is never immediately followed by $C$, and $C$ is never immediately followed by $A$. How many seven-letter good words are there?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are three choices for the first letter and two choices for each subsequent letter, so there are $3\\cdot2^{n-1}\\ n$-letter good words.  Substitute $n=7$ to find there are $3\\cdot2^6=\\boxed{192}$ seven-letter good words.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what is meant by a \"good word\" in this context?\n2. How many choices are there for the first letter of a seven-letter good word? Why?\n3. Why are there only two choices for each subsequent letter in the word?\n4. How can we express the total number of n-letter good words using the given information?\n5. Can you substitute n=7 into the expression to calculate the number of seven-letter good words?\n6. Can you explain why multiplying 3 by 2^6 gives us the total number of seven-letter good words?\n7. Are there any restrictions or conditions that need to be satisfied for a word to be considered \"good\"?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios or examples where a similar counting and probability approach could be applied?\n9. How would the calculation change if the word length was different? Can you generalize the formula?\n10. What insights can we gain from analyzing and understanding the concept of \"good words\" in this context?"
