    "problem": "Keisha's basketball team must decide on a new uniform.  The seventh-graders will pick the color of the shorts (black or gold) and the eighth-graders will pick the color of the jersey (black, white, or gold), but the two groups of players will not confer together.  If, for both garments, each possible color is equally likely to be chosen, what is the probability that the shorts will be a different color than the jersey? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "We will count the number of garment configurations in which the garments do not match color and divide by the total number of garment configurations in order to find the probability that the garments do not match. If the seventh-graders choose a black garment, there are two garments the eighth-graders can choose such that the garments don't match: white and gold. If the seventh-graders choose a gold garment, there are two garments the eighth-graders can choose to not match: black and white. Thus, there are $2+2=4$ garment configurations such that the garments don't match. The total number of garment configurations is $2\\cdot3=6$ (one of two shorts and one of three jerseys), so the probability that the garments don't match is $4/6=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the problem scenario presented in the question?\n2. What are the two groups of players responsible for in terms of color selection for the uniform?\n3. Are the two groups of players allowed to communicate with each other when deciding on the uniform colors? If not, what does this imply for the probability of the shorts and jersey being of different colors?\n4. What is the total number of possible garment configurations that can be created given the color options available for the shorts and jersey?\n5. How many garment configurations result in the shorts and jersey being of different colors? Can you explain your reasoning?\n6. Using this information, what is the probability that the shorts and jersey will be of different colors? Can you express your answer as a simplified fraction? \n7. Are there any other methods that could be used to calculate this probability? If so, can you explain their logic and whether they would yield the same result as the method presented in the question?"
