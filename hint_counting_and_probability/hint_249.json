    "problem": "My school's math club has 6 boys and 8 girls.  I need to select a team to send to the state math competition.  We want 6 people on the team.  In how many ways can I select the team to have 3 boys and 3 girls?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We are picking 3 boys out of 6, so there are $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$ options for the boys on the team.  We are picking 3 girls out of 8, so there are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ options for the girls on the team.  This gives a total of $20 \\times 56 = \\boxed{1120}$ choices.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the problem is asking us to find?\n2. How many boys and girls do we have in total?\n3. How many people do we need to select for the team?\n4. How many ways can we choose 3 boys out of 6? What formula can we use to calculate this?\n5. How many ways can we choose 3 girls out of 8? What formula can we use to calculate this?\n6. Why do we multiply the number of ways to select boys with the number of ways to select girls?\n7. Can you explain why we use the multiplication principle in this case?\n8. Can you calculate the total number of choices using the given information?"
