    "problem": "How many positive three-digit integers less than 500 have at least two digits that are the same?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Case 1: The last two digits of our integer are equal.  There are 10 possibilities for these last two digits and 4 choices for the hundred's digit, of a total of 40 possibilities.  (Note that this case includes 111, 222, 333, and 444.)\n\nCase 2: The first two digits are equal and the third is different.  This occurs in $4\\cdot 9 = 36$ ways, since we can choose the repeated digit in 4 ways and the remaining digit in 9.\n\nCase 3:  The first and third digits are equal while the second is different.  This also occurs in 36 ways.\n\nThus we have a total of $40 + 36 + 36 = \\boxed{112}$ integers.\n\nOR\n\nAnother way to solve this problem is to find how many three-digit integers less than 500 have no digits that are the same. The first digit must be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The second digit can be any of the 9 digits not yet chosen, and the third digit can be any of the 8 digits not yet chosen, so there are a total of $4 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 = 288$ three-digit integers that have no digits that are the same and are less than 500. There are a total of $500 - 100 = 400$ three-digit integers that are less than 500, so we have a total of $400 - 288 = \\boxed{112}$ integers that fit the problem.

    "socratic_questions": "1. How many positive three-digit integers are there less than 500?\n2. In how many three-digit integers less than 500 are the last two digits the same?\n3. How did you calculate that there are 10 possibilities for the last two digits in Case 1?\n4. In Case 2, why can we only choose the repeated digit for the first two digits?\n5. In Case 3, why can we only choose the repeated digit for the first and third digits?\n6. How did you calculate the total number of integers that fit the problem?\n7. Can you think of any other strategies to solve this problem?"
