    "problem": "Twenty tiles are numbered 1 through 20 and are placed into box $A$. Twenty other tiles numbered 11 through 30 are placed into box $B$. One tile is randomly drawn from each box. What is the probability that the tile from box $A$ is less than 15 and the tile from box $B$ is either even or greater than 25? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "Since the two events are independent, we consider each separately. The probability of the tile from A being less than 15 is equal to $\\frac{14}{20} = \\frac{7}{10}$. The probability of a tile from B being even or greater than 25 is $\\frac{10+2}{20} = \\frac{3}{5}$. So we multiply the probabilities for the independent events, giving us probability $\\frac{7}{10} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = \\boxed{\\frac{21}{50}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the possible outcomes when drawing a tile from box A? And from box B?\n2. How many tiles are in each box? How does this affect the probability of drawing a specific tile?\n3. What is the probability of drawing a tile from box A that is less than 15? How did you come up with that probability? \n4. What is the probability of drawing a tile from box B that is either even or greater than 25? How did you calculate that probability?\n5. Are the events of drawing from box A and box B independent? Why or why not?\n6. How can we calculate the probability of both events happening - the tile from A being less than 15 and the tile from B being either even or greater than 25?\n7. What happens when we multiply the probabilities of two independent events?\n8. How can we express the final probability as a common fraction?"
