    "problem": "Our club has 20 members, 10 boys and 10 girls.  In how many ways can we choose a president and a vice-president if they must be of different gender?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The president can be any one of the 20 members, and the vice-president can be any one of the 10 members of the opposite sex. The answer is $20\\times 10=\\boxed{200}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the problem is asking for? \n2. How many members are in the club? Are there an equal number of boys and girls? \n3. If the president and vice-president must be of different genders, how does that limit the possible choices? \n4. Can you walk me through the process of finding the number of ways to choose a president and vice-president of different genders? \n5. Are there any assumptions we are making about the gender identities of the members in this problem? \n6. How would the answer change if we allowed the president and vice-president to be of the same gender?"
