    "problem": "Six 6-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that the number of dice showing even numbers and the number of dice showing odd numbers is equal?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{6}{3}$ ways for 3 of the dice to show even numbers and 3 of them to show odd numbers.  Each roll is even with probability $\\frac12$ and odd with probability $\\frac12$, so each arrangement of 3 odd numbers and 3 even number occurs with probability $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!6}$.  Thus, the probability that 3 dice out of 6 show even numbers is \\[\\binom{6}{3}\\frac{1}{2^6}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define the event where the number of dice showing even numbers is equal to the number showing odd numbers?\n2. Can you explain why we choose to focus on 3 dice showing even numbers and 3 dice showing odd numbers? Is there any significance to this choice?\n3. How many ways can we select 3 dice out of the 6 to show even numbers? Can you explain why this is represented by $\\binom{6}{3}$?\n4. Each roll of a single die has an equal probability of being even or odd. How does this information help us determine the probability of each arrangement of dice showing 3 odd and 3 even numbers?\n5. Each arrangement of dice showing 3 odd and 3 even numbers occurs with a certain probability. What is that probability? Can you explain why it is equal to $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\!6}$?\n6. Knowing the number of ways to have 3 dice showing even numbers and the probability of each arrangement, how can we determine the overall probability of the event we defined in question 1?"
