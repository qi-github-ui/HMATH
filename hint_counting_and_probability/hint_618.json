    "problem": "Ten distinct points are identified on the circumference of a circle. How many different convex quadrilaterals can be formed if each vertex must be one of these 10 points?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "With the ten points on the circumference of a circle, any set of 4 of them will form a convex (indeed, cyclic) quadrilateral. So, with ten points, and we can choose any 4 of them to form a distinct quadrilateral, we get ${10 \\choose 4} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2} = 10 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{210}$ quadrilaterals.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what a convex quadrilateral is?\n2. Given 10 distinct points on a circle, how many different ways can you choose 4 of them to form a quadrilateral?\n3. What does it mean for the quadrilateral to be distinct in this scenario?\n4. How many different ways can you choose 4 points out of 10?\n5. What formula can we use to calculate the number of combinations?\n6. Can you apply the formula to find the number of distinct quadrilaterals that can be formed in this scenario?\n7. Is there any particular reasoning or pattern that can help simplify the calculation?\n8. Can you suggest an alternative approach to solving this problem?\n9. Are there any other considerations or constraints we need to take into account in this problem?\n10. Can you think of any real-life examples or applications where counting and probability concepts like this might be useful?"
