    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you define what \"combinations\" mean in counting and probability?\n2. How many ways can you choose 1 item from a pool of 5 items? \n3. Can you describe the difference between combinations and permutations? \n4. How would you modify your approach if you wanted to choose 2 items instead of 1 from the pool of 5 items? \n5. What is the relationship between the calculation of $\\dbinom{5}{1}$ and the formula for combinations $\\dbinom{n}{k}=\\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$?\n6. Can you provide an example scenario where the calculation of $\\dbinom{5}{1}$ would be useful in calculating probability?"
