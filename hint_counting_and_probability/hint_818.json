    "solution": "Look at the coefficients of the powers of 101: 1, -4, 6, -4, 1. You might recognize these as $\\binom40$, $-\\binom41$, $\\binom42$, $-\\binom43$, $\\binom44$. This suggests that the Binomial Theorem is in play. Indeed, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(101 + (-1))^4 &= \\binom40 \\cdot 101^{4} \\cdot (-1)^0 + \\binom41 \\cdot 101^{3} \\cdot (-1)^1 + \\\\\n&\\phantom{=} \\binom42 \\cdot 101^2 \\cdot (-1)^2 + \\binom43 \\cdot 101^1 \\cdot (-1)^3 + \\\\\n&\\phantom{=} \\binom44 \\cdot 101^0 \\cdot (-1)^4\\\\\n& = 101^{4} - 4 \\cdot 101^{3} + 6 \\cdot 101^2 - 4 \\cdot 101 + 1.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, we have $(101 + (-1))^4 = 100^4 = \\boxed{100000000}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the pattern you see in the coefficients of the powers of 101?\n2. How does recognizing the coefficients as binomial coefficients help in this problem?\n3. What is the Binomial Theorem and how does it relate to this problem?\n4. Can you write out the expanded form of $(101 + (-1))^4$ using the Binomial Theorem?\n5. How does this expanded form match the expression $101^{4} - 4 \\cdot 101^{3} + 6 \\cdot 101^2 - 4 \\cdot 101 + 1$?\n6. What is the value of $(101 + (-1))^4$?\n7. How does this value lead to the final answer of $100^4$?\n8. Can you apply a similar approach to other expressions or problems?"
