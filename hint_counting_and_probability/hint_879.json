    "problem": "You have $5$ red shirts, $5$ green shirts, $6$ pairs of pants, $8$ green hats and $8$ red hats, all of which are distinct. How many outfits can you make consisting of one shirt, one pair of pants, and one hat without having the same color of shirts and hats?",

    "solution": "Consider two cases:\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 1: the person wears a red shirt and a green hat. There are $5$ options for shirts, $6$ options for pants, and $8$ options for hats, for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 8 = 240$ outfits.\n\n$\\bullet$  Case 2: the person wears a green shirt and a red hat. There are $5$ options for shirts, $6$ options for pants, and $8$ options for hats, for a total of $5 \\times 6 \\times 8 = 240$ outfits.\n\nSumming up the two cases, we have a total possibility of $240+240 = \\boxed{480}$ outfits.\n\nNotice that we can tackle this without considering cases. The person has $10$ choices for shirts. After a shirt is chosen, the person has $6$ choices for pants, but only $8$ choices of hat, since the hat color cannot match the shirt color, and no matter what shirt color is chosen, there are $8$ hats of the other color to choose from. So, there are $10\\times 6\\times 8 =\\boxed{480}$ outfits.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you restate the problem in your own words?\n2. What are the options for the color of the shirt?\n3. How many options are there for the pants?\n4. How many options are there for the hat?\n5. Why do we need to ensure that the color of the shirt and hat are different?\n6. In the first case, when the person wears a red shirt and a green hat, how many outfits are possible?\n7. In the second case, when the person wears a green shirt and a red hat, how many outfits are possible?\n8. Why do we need to consider both cases?\n9. How do we find the total number of outfits by combining the results of both cases?\n10. Can we solve this problem without considering cases? If so, what would be the approach?"
