    "problem": "No two students in Mrs. Vale's 26-student mathematics class have the same two initials. Each student's first name and last name begin with the same letter. If the letter ``Y'' is considered a vowel, what is the probability of randomly picking a student whose initials are vowels? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The students' initials are AA, BB, CC, $\\cdots$, ZZ, representing all 26 letters. The vowels are A, E, I, O, U, and Y, which are 6 letters out of the possible 26. So the probability of picking a student whose initials are vowels is $\\frac{6}{26}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{13}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the problem is asking for?\n2. What does it mean when it says no two students have the same two initials? How many different possible initials can there be?\n3. How many students are in Mrs. Vale's math class?\n4. How many possible initials are there using the 26 letters of the alphabet?\n5. How many initials are considered vowels according to the problem?\n6. Why is the letter \"Y\" included as a vowel in this problem?\n7. What is the probability of randomly picking a student whose initials are vowels? How did you calculate this?\n8. Can you explain how this problem relates to the concepts of counting and probability?"
