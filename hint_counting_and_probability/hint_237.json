    "problem": "In how many ways can 9 people sit around a round table?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $9!$ ways to arrange 9 people in a line, however there are 9 identical rotations for each arrangement, so we divide by 9 to get $\\dfrac{9!}{9} = 8! = \\boxed{40,\\!320}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find?\n2. How many people are there in total that need to be seated?\n3. Why do we need to divide by 9 at the end?\n4. Can you explain what is meant by \"identical rotations\"?\n5. Are there any other situations where we would need to consider rotations in our counting?\n6. What would happen if the table was rectangular instead of round? Would that change our answer?\n7. How would the problem be different if some of the people are not allowed to sit next to each other?\n8. Can you think of any real-life situations where this type of counting might be useful?"
