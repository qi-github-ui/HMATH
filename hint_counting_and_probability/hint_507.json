    "problem": "Two cards are dealt from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card dealt is a $\\diamondsuit$ and the second card dealt is a $\\spadesuit$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Once a $\\diamondsuit$ is dealt, there are only 51 cards left in the deck, so the probability of the second card being a $\\spadesuit$ is $\\frac{13}{51}$, not $\\frac14.$ Therefore, the probability of both cards being the required suits is $\\frac14 \\times \\frac{13}{51} =\\boxed{ \\frac{13}{204}}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of cards in a standard deck?\n2. How many $\\diamondsuit$ cards are there in a standard deck?\n3. If the first card dealt is a $\\diamondsuit$, how many $\\diamondsuit$ cards are left in the deck?\n4. What is the likelihood of drawing a $\\spadesuit$ as the second card from the remaining $\\diamondsuit$ cards?\n5. Can the order of drawing the cards affect the probability of getting the required suits?\n6. How many $\\spadesuit$ cards are in a standard deck?\n7. What is the probability of getting a $\\spadesuit$ as the second card from the entire deck?\n8. How can we calculate the probability of both cards being the required suits?"
