    "problem": "How many different positive, six-digit integers can be formed using the digits 2, 2, 5, 5, 9 and 9?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We could go ahead and count these directly, but instead we could count in general and then correct for overcounting. That is, if we had 6 distinct digits, there would be $6! = 720$ orderings. However, we must divide by 2! once for the repetition of the digit 2, 2! for the repetition of the digit 5, and again 2! for the repetition of the digit 9 (this should make sense because if the repeated digits were different then we could rearrange them in 2! ways).  So, our answer is $\\frac{6!}{2!\\cdot 2!\\cdot 2!} = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of six-digit integers that can be formed using the given digits without any restrictions?\n2. How does the repetition of digits affect the number of possible arrangements?\n3. Why do we need to divide by 2! for the repetition of the digit 2, 2! for the repetition of the digit 5, and again 2! for the repetition of the digit 9?\n4. Can you explain why we divide by the factorials of the repetition counts instead of just the repetition counts?\n5. Are there any other ways to approach this problem without using factorials and division?\n6. Can you think of a scenario where there are more than two repeated digits? How would you adjust the calculation in that case?"
