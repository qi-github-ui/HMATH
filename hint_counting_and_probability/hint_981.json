    "problem": "The number 121 is a palindrome, because it reads the same backwards as forward. How many integer palindromes are between 100 and 500?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The hundreds digit can be any one of 1, 2, 3 or 4. Whatever the hundreds digit is, that fixes what the units digit can be. Then, there are 10 choices for the middle (tens) digit. So, we can construct $4 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{40}$ palindromes by choosing the digits.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define a palindrome? \n2. What is the range of numbers that we are considering? \n3. How many choices do we have for the hundreds digit? \n4. Why does the choice of the hundreds digit fix the units digit? \n5. How many choices do we have for the middle (tens) digit? \n6. How can we determine the total number of palindromes by combining the choices for the hundreds, middle, and units digits? \n7. Can you explain why we multiply the number of choices for each digit in order to get the total number of palindromes? \n8. What is the final answer, i.e. the number of integer palindromes between 100 and 500?"
