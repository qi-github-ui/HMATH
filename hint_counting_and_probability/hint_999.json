    "problem": "A card is chosen at random from a standard deck of 52 cards, and then it is replaced and another card is chosen. What is the probability that at least one of the cards is a diamond or an ace?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 16 cards in a standard deck which are either diamonds or aces. The probability that neither card chosen is a diamond or an ace is $\\left( \\frac{36}{52} \\right) ^2=\\left( \\frac{9}{13} \\right) ^2=\\frac{81}{169}$. Therefore, the probability that at least one of the cards chosen was a diamond or an ace is $1-\\frac{81}{169}=\\boxed{\\frac{88}{169}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the experiment being conducted in this problem? \n2. How many cards are in a standard deck, and how are they divided among the suits and face values? \n3. What is the probability of drawing a diamond on the first draw, and how does that change for the second draw? \n4. What is the probability of drawing an ace on the first draw, and how does that change for the second draw? \n5. How do we calculate the probability of drawing at least one diamond or ace, and why do we subtract from 1? \n6. What is the probability of drawing neither a diamond nor an ace? \n7. How can we use the answer to the previous question to find the answer to the original question? \n8. Can you think of any variations on this problem that would require a different method of calculation?"
