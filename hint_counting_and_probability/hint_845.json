    "solution": "Regardless of whether $x_1$ is odd or even, we have 5 choices for $x_2$: if $x_1$ is odd then $x_2$ must be one of the 5 even digits, otherwise if $x_1$ is even then $x_2$ must be one of the 5 odd digits.  Similarly, we then have 5 choices for $x_3$, 5 choices for $x_4$, and so on.\n\nSince $x_1$ can be any of the 10 digits, the answer is $10 \\times 5^5=\\boxed{31,250}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the given condition in your own words? What does it mean for no two adjacent $x_i$ to have the same parity?\n2. How many choices do we have for the first digit, $x_1$? Why?\n3. Assuming $x_1$ is odd, how many choices do we have for $x_2$? Why?\n4. What if $x_1$ is even? How many choices do we have for $x_2$ in that case? Why?\n5. How many choices do we have for $x_3$? Can you explain the reasoning behind it?\n6. Continuing with this pattern, how many choices do we have for $x_4$, $x_5$, and $x_6$ respectively?\n7. Combining all the choices together, how many possible sequences of 6 digits can we form that satisfy the given condition?\n8. Can you calculate the final answer?\n9. Are there any limitations or assumptions in this solution? Is there anything we need to consider or clarify?\n10. Can you think of any similar problems or scenarios where the concept of counting and probability can be applied?"
