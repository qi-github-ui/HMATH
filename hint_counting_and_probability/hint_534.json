    "problem": "A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 26 ways to choose the first card to be red, then 26 ways to choose the second card to be black.  There are $52 \\times 51$ ways to choose any two cards.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{26 \\times 26}{52 \\times 51} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{51}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define probability?\n2. Can you describe the sample space in this scenario? What are all the possible outcomes?\n3. How many total cards are there in the deck? What does this represent in terms of the sample space?\n4. How many ways can we choose a red card as the first card? Why is it 26?\n5. How many ways can we choose a black card as the second card, given that the first card is red? Why is it 26 as well?\n6. Why do we multiply the number of ways to choose the red card and the number of ways to choose the black card? What does this multiplication represent?\n7. How many ways can we choose any two cards from the deck? Why is it $52 \\times 51$?\n8. How does the probability of the desired outcome relate to the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes?\n9. How can we calculate the probability of the top card being red and the second card being black using the information we have gathered?\n10. Can you simplify the fraction representing the probability? Does it make sense intuitively?"
