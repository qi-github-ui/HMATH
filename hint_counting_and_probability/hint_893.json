    "problem": "How many different positive three-digit integers can be formed using only the digits in the set $\\{2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6\\}$ if no digit may be used more times than it appears in the given set of available digits?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "If all three digits are different, there are 4 choices for the first digit, 3 for the second, and 2 for the third, giving $(4)(3)(2) = 24$ integers. If two of them are the same, the repeated digit digit is either 5 or 6. There are 2 choices for the repeated digit, then 3 choices for the non-repeating digit, and 3 ways to arrange these digits (for example, if the repeating digit is 5 and the non-repeating digit is 6, we can have 655, 565, and 556). This gives $(2)(3)(3) = 18$ integers. Finally, if all three digits are the same, the number must be 555. So there are $24+18+1 = \\boxed{43}$ possible integers.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find?\n2. How many digits are available to use and what are they?\n3. What is the maximum number of times each digit can be used?\n4. What is the first step you would take in solving this problem?\n5. If all three digits must be different, how many choices do we have for the first digit? And for the second and third digits?\n6. If two digits are the same, what are the possible repeated digits and how many choices do we have for the non-repeating digit?\n7. How many ways are there to arrange two different digits and one repeated digit?\n8. If all three digits are the same, what is the only possible integer?\n9. How do we add up the number of possible integers in the three different cases?\n10. Are there any other cases we need to consider?"
