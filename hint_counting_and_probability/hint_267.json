    "problem": "Four horizontal lines and four vertical lines are drawn in a plane. In how many ways can four lines be chosen such that a rectangular region is enclosed?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "In order for the four lines to enclose a rectangular region, we must choose two horizontal and two vertical lines.  If we were to choose more than two of one of these types of lines, we would not be able to enclose any region.  We can count independently the number of ways to choose vertical and horizontal lines.  There will be $\\dbinom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose horizontal lines, and the same number of ways to choose two vertical lines.  Since these are independent, there are a total of $6\\cdot 6=\\boxed{36}$ ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the condition that must be satisfied in order for four lines to enclose a rectangular region? \n2. How many horizontal and vertical lines are needed to enclose a rectangular region? \n3. Why can we count independently the number of ways to choose horizontal and vertical lines? \n4. How many ways are there to choose two horizontal lines, and how did you arrive at this number? \n5. How many ways are there to choose two vertical lines, and how did you arrive at this number? \n6. What is the total number of ways to choose four lines that enclose a rectangle, and why do we multiply the number of ways to choose horizontal and vertical lines? \n7. Can you think of any other scenarios where we would need to count the number of ways to choose a combination of horizontal and vertical lines?"
