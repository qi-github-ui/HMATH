    "problem": "How many even three-digit integers  have the property that their digits, read left to right, are in strictly increasing order (each digit is greater than the previous digit)?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Let the integer have digits $a$, $b$, and $c$, read left to right.  Because $1 \\leq a<b<c$, none of the digits can be zero and $c$ cannot be 2.  If $c=4$, then $a$ and $b$ must each be chosen from the digits 1, 2, and 3.  Therefore there are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ choices for $a$ and $b$, and for each choice there is one acceptable order.  Similarly, for $c=6$ and $c=8$ there are, respectively, $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ and $\\binom{7}{2}=21$ choices for $a$ and $b$. Thus there are altogether $3+10+21=\\boxed{34}$ such integers.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the restrictions on the digits of the three-digit integer in order for it to have the desired property?\n2. Why can't any of the digits be zero in the three-digit integer?\n3. If the largest digit is 4, what are the possible choices for the other two digits?\n4. How many different ways can we choose two digits from the set {1, 2, 3}?\n5. For each choice of the other two digits, is there only one valid order that satisfies the given condition? Why or why not?\n6. Following the same reasoning, what are the possible choices for the other two digits if the largest digit is 6 or 8?\n7. How many different ways can we choose two digits from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} or {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}?\n8. How many three-digit integers satisfy the desired property with each of the largest digits (4, 6, and 8)?\n9. What is the total number of three-digit integers that have the property of strictly increasing digits?"
