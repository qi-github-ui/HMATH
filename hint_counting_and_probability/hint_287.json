    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $5!$ ways to arrange the books if they are unique, but two are identical so we must divide by $2!$ for an answer of $\\dfrac{5!}{2!} = \\boxed{60}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many books are there in total?\n2. How many of these books are identical?\n3. If we ignore the identical books for now, how many ways can we arrange the remaining books on the shelf?\n4. How many ways can we arrange the identical books if they were all different?\n5. How does the fact that two of the books are identical affect the total number of arrangements?\n6. How do we account for the arrangements where the identical books are swapped with each other?\n7. What division operation should we use to account for the duplicate arrangements?\n8. Can you calculate the number of arrangements with the given information?"
