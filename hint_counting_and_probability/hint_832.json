    "solution": "It may not be obvious how to proceed with this problem, but a little experimentation might lead you to determine the possible values of $m.$\n\nSince $0 < m^2 < 22,$ we can see that $m$ must be one of $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ or $4.$ So let's use these as our cases.\n\nCase 1: When $m=1$, we must have $n < 22-1 = 21.$ Thus there are $20$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=1.$\nCase 2: When $m=2,$ we must have $n < 22-4 = 18.$ Thus there are $17$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=2.$\nCase 3: When $m=3,$ we must have $n < 22-9 = 13.$ Thus there are $12$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=3.$\nCase 4: When $m=4,$ we must have $n < 22-16 = 6.$ Thus there are $5$ possible choices for $n$ when $m=4.$\n\nSo to get the total number of pairs of positive integers satisfying the inequality, we add up all of our possible cases, and see that there are $20 + 17 + 12 + 5 = \\boxed{54}$ possible pairs.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find?\n2. Can you rephrase the problem using your own words?\n3. Let's consider some examples with different values of m. What are the possible values for m that satisfy the given condition?\n4. For each possible value of m, what is the range of values for n that satisfy the inequality? \n5. How did you determine the range of values for n in each case?\n6. Can you explain why we considered cases based on the possible values of m?\n7. What is the pattern or relationship you observe between the values of m and the number of possible pairs (m, n)?\n8. Can you generalize your findings to find the total number of pairs that satisfy the inequality?"
