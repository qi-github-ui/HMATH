    "problem": "Mr. and Mrs. Lopez have two children.  When they get into their family car, two people sit in the front, and the other two sit in the back.  Either Mr. Lopez or Mrs. Lopez must sit in the driver's seat.  How many seating arrangements are possible?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are only two possible occupants for the driver's seat. After the driver is chosen, any of the remaining three people can sit in the front, and there are two arrangements for the other two people  in the back.  Thus, there are $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 2 =\n\\boxed{12}$ possible seating arrangements.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to count?\n2. How many people are in the Lopez family?\n3. What are the options for who can sit in the driver's seat?\n4. How many ways can we choose 1 person to sit in the driver's seat?\n5. Once the driver is chosen, how many people are left to sit in the front seat?\n6. How many ways can we choose 2 people to sit in the back seat?\n7. How do we calculate the total number of possible seating arrangements?\n8. Can you think of a similar problem in which the number of people or seats is different? How would you approach counting the arrangements in that case?"
