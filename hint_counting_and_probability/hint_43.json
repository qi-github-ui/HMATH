    "problem": "Robert likes chocolate milk, so he decides to visit the milk bottling plant every day for a week to get the free samples. Unfortunately for him, the bottling plant sometimes bottles regular milk instead of chocolate milk, so each day the plant has a 2/3 chance of bottling chocolate milk. What is the probability that the bottling plant bottles chocolate milk exactly 4 of the 5 days he visits?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{5}{4}=5$ ways to choose which 4 of the 5 days the plant will bottle chocolate milk. For each choice, there is a probability of $\\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^1$ that on those 4 days they will be bottling chocolate milk and on the other day they will not. Therefore, the total probability on that exactly 4 of the 5 days they will be bottling chocolate milk is $5 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^1 = \\boxed{\\frac{80}{243}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define probability in this context? Can you explain it in simple terms?\n2. What information do we have about the bottling plant's behavior? How does this information relate to the concept of probability? \n3. Can you explain why each day has a 2/3 chance of bottling chocolate milk and a 1/3 chance of bottling regular milk? \n4. What does it mean to have \"exactly 4 of the 5 days\" for chocolate milk bottling? Can you think of any other interpretations of this condition?\n5. How many different ways can the plant bottle chocolate milk on 4 out of the 5 days? Can you explain why it's equal to $\\binom{5}{4}$?\n6. For each of these 5 ways, what's the probability of chocolate milk bottling on those 4 days and not on the other day? Can you explain why it's $\\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^4 \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^1$ for each choice?\n7. How can you use the probability of each choice to find the total probability of the plant bottling chocolate milk on 4 out of the 5 days? Can you explain why we multiply the probabilities by the number of ways?\n8. What is the final probability that the bottling plant bottles chocolate milk exactly 4 of the 5 days? Can you calculate the exact value?"
