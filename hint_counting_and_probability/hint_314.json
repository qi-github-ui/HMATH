    "problem": "Allen and Bethany each arrive at a party at a random time between 1:00 and 2:00.  Each stays for 15 minutes, then leaves.  What is the probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party?",

    "solution": "We let the $x$ axis represent the time Allen arrives, and the $y$ axis represent the time Bethany arrives.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(60,0), Arrow);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,60), Arrow);\nlabel(\"1:00\", (0,0), SW);\nlabel(\"1:15\", (0,15), W);\nlabel(\"1:45\", (60,45), E);\nlabel(\"1:15\", (15,0), S);\nlabel(\"2:00\", (60,0), S);\nlabel(\"2:00\", (0,60), W);\nfill((0,0)--(60,60)--(60,45)--(15,0)--cycle, gray(.7));\nfill((0,0)--(60,60)--(45,60)--(0,15)--cycle, gray(.7));\n[/asy]\n\nThe shaded region represents the times that Allen and Bethany would see each other at the party.  For example, if Allen arrived at 1:30, Bethany could arrive at any time between 1:15 and 1:45 and see Allen at the party.  Let one hour equal one unit.  Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles.  This will be equal to $2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{9}{16}$.  So, the area of the shaded region is $1-\\frac{9}{16}=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{16}}$.  Since the area of the square is 1, this is the probability that Allen and Bethany see each other at the party.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe how we can think of the problem geometrically using the axes and the shaded region?\n2. What does the shaded region represent in terms of the times Allen and Bethany arrive at the party?\n3. How can we calculate the probability of Allen and Bethany seeing each other at the party using the areas of the shaded and unshaded regions?\n4. Why do we subtract the areas of the two unshaded triangles from the area of the entire square?\n5. How did we determine the dimensions of the triangles and the square in terms of time units?\n6. Can you think of any other scenarios or examples where we can use similar geometric reasoning to calculate probabilities?\n7. What assumptions are we making about the arrival times of Allen and Bethany in this problem?\n8. Is this the only method to calculate the probability? Can you think of any alternative approaches?"
