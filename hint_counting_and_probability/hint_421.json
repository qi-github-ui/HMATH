    "problem": "Ben rolls 5 fair 12-sided dice.  The 12 faces of each die are numbered from 1 to 12. What is the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that a 12-sided die will show an even number and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that it will show an odd number. We can choose which dice will show the even numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways. For each way, there is a $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^5=\\frac{1}{32}$ probability that the chosen dice actually roll even numbers and the other dice roll odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is $10\\cdot \\frac{1}{32}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{16}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem? What is the initial thing you need to determine?\n2. How many sides does each die have, and what are the possible outcomes when rolling each die?\n3. What is the probability of rolling an even number on a 12-sided die? And what is the probability of rolling an odd number on the same die?\n4. How many dice are being rolled in total, and how many of them do you want to show an even number?\n5. How many ways are there to choose exactly two dice to show even numbers out of the five dice being rolled?\n6. For each way of choosing two dice, what is the probability that those dice show even numbers and the other dice show odd numbers?\n7. How do you calculate the probability for each choice of two dice showing even numbers?\n8. After calculating the individual probabilities for each choice of two dice, what is the final probability that exactly two dice show an even number?\n9. Is there any other similar scenario where you can apply similar reasoning and steps to solve for the probability?"
