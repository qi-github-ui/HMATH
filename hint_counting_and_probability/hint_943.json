    "problem": "Henry's little brother has $8$ identical stickers and $4$ identical sheets of paper. How many ways are there for him to put all of the stickers on the sheets of paper, if only the number of stickers on each sheet matters?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since only the number of stickers on the sheets matters, we can list the possibilities systematically:  \\begin{align*}\n& 8-0-0-0 \\\\\n& 7-1-0-0 \\\\\n& 6-2-0-0 \\\\\n& 6-1-1-0 \\\\\n& 5-3-0-0 \\\\\n& 5-2-1-0 \\\\\n& 5-1-1-1 \\\\\n& 4-4-0-0 \\\\\n& 4-3-1-0 \\\\\n& 4-2-2-0 \\\\\n& 4-2-1-1 \\\\\n& 3-3-2-0 \\\\\n& 3-3-1-1 \\\\\n& 3-2-2-1 \\\\\n& 2-2-2-2\n\\end{align*} There are $\\boxed{15}$ possible arrangements of stickers on sheets of paper.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the question asking for in this problem?\n2. How many stickers does Henry's little brother have in total? How many sheets of paper does he have?\n3. Why do we not need to consider the order in which the stickers are placed on the sheets of paper?\n4. What is the maximum number of stickers that can be placed on any one sheet of paper?\n5. Is it possible to have all of the stickers on one sheet of paper? If so, how many ways are there to do this?\n6. How many ways are there to have exactly two sheets of paper with two stickers each and the other two sheets with no stickers?\n7. Are there any arrangements that are impossible? If so, why?\n8. Can you think of any real-life situations where counting the number of possible arrangements like this might be important?"
