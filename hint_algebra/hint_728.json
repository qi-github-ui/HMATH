    "problem": "Jack rewrites the quadratic $9x^2 - 30x - 42$ in the form of $(ax + b)^2 + c,$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are all integers. What is $ab$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that $(ax + b)^2 + c = (a^2)x^2 + (2ab)x + b^2 + c,$ meaning that if this to equal $9x^2 - 30x - 42$, we start with $a^2 = 9,$ and so we let $a = 3.$ Then, $2ab = -30,$ so $b = -5.$ We do not need to find $c$ in this case, so our answer is $ab = \\boxed{-15}.$\n\nNote: Letting $a = -3$ gives us $(-3x+5)^2 + c,$ which gives us the same answer.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you rewrite the quadratic $9x^2 - 30x - 42$ in the form $(ax + b)^2 + c$?\n2. What do you think is the purpose of rewriting the quadratic in this form? What do we gain from doing so?\n3. If we expand $(ax + b)^2 + c$, what terms would we get? How can we compare them with the given quadratic?\n4. Based on the expanded form, what values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ do you think would make the equation equivalent to $9x^2 - 30x - 42$?\n5. How can we determine the value of $ab$ from the expanded form of $(ax + b)^2 + c$?\n6. Are there any restrictions or requirements on the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ when rewriting the quadratic in the form $(ax + b)^2 + c$?\n7. Can you think of any other similar problems or situations where rewriting a quadratic in this form would be useful?"
