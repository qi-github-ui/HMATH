    "problem": "In a certain colony of bacteria, the number of bacteria doubles every day. The colony starts with 3 bacteria, and has 6 at the end of day 1, 12 at the end of day 2, and so on. What is the number of the first day which ends with the colony having more than 100 bacteria?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The number of bacteria is multiplied by 2 at the end of each day, so the number of bacteria at the end of day $n$ is $3\\cdot2^n$. We want $3\\cdot2^n > 100$, or $2^n > 33\\frac{1}{3}$. The smallest $n$ for which this happens is $n = \\boxed{6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How does the number of bacteria in the colony change each day?\n2. Can you describe the growth pattern of the colony in terms of doubling?\n3. How many bacteria are there at the end of the first day? How did you calculate that?\n4. Can you determine the number of bacteria at the end of the second day using the doubling pattern? How would you calculate it?\n5. How can you generalize the doubling pattern to calculate the number of bacteria at the end of any given day?\n6. At which day does the colony have more than 100 bacteria? How did you figure that out?\n7. Is there a specific formula or equation that represents the growth of the bacteria colony? If so, what is it? How does it relate to the task at hand?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios where the idea of exponential growth, like the doubling of bacteria, might be applicable?"
