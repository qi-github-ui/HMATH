    "problem": "Solve for $x$, if $8^{4x-6}=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+5}$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $8=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{-3}$ the equation can be rewritten as $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{-3(4x-6)}=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{x+5}$. From this equation, we see that $-3(4x-6)=x+5$. Simplifying we get, \\begin{align*}\n-12x+18&=x+5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow -13x+18&=5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow -13x&=-13\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x&=\\boxed{1}.\n\\end{align*}",
