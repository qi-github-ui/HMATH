    "problem": "$k, a_2, a_3$ and $k, b_2, b_3$ are both nonconstant geometric sequences with different common ratios.  We have  $$a_3-b_3=3(a_2-b_2).$$Find the sum of the common ratios of the two sequences.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the common ratio of the first sequence be $p$ and the common ratio of the second sequence be $r$.  Then the equation becomes\n\n$$kp^2-kr^2=3(kp-kr)$$Dividing both sides by $k$ (since the sequences are nonconstant, no term can be $0$), we get\n\n$$p^2-r^2=3(p-r)$$The left side factors as $(p-r)(p+r)$.  Since $p\\neq r$, we can divide by $p-r$ to get\n\n$$p+r=\\boxed{3}$$",

Can you identify the common ratios in the sequences $k, a_2, a_3$ and $k, b_2, b_3$?\n4. What does it mean by $a_3-b_3=3(a_2-b_2)$? Can you rewrite this equation in terms of the common ratios of the sequences?\n5. How can you use the given equation to find a relationship between the common ratios? Can you solve for one of the common ratios in terms of the other?\n6. What is the significance of having different common ratios in the two sequences? How does it affect the overall problem?\n7. How can you find the sum of the common ratios from the given equation and the relationship you derived between the common ratios?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios or problems where similar reasoning and steps would be useful?"
