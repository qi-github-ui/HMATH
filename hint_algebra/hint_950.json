    "problem": "For how many values of $a$ is it true that the line $y=x+a$ passes through the vertex of parabola $y=x^2+a^2$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The given parabola has vertex at $(0,a^2)$. The line $y=x+a$ passes through this point if and only if $a^2=0+a$. Rearranging the equation gives $a^2-a=0$. Factoring an $a$ out of the left hand side yields $a(a-1)=0$, so $a=0$ or $a=1$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ possible values of $a$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the equation of the line and the parabola in terms of their general forms?\n2. How can we determine the vertex of a parabola based on its equation? What do we need to find in order to locate the vertex?\n3. How can we find the coordinates of the vertex of the parabola $y=x^2+a^2$? Can we represent it in terms of $a$?\n4. If a line passes through the vertex of a parabola, can we make any observations about the relationship between their equations? What conditions must be met?\n5. What does the equation $y=x+a$ tell us about the slope and intercept of the line? How can these characteristics be related to the vertex of the parabola?\n6. Can you set up an equation to represent the coordinates of the vertex of the parabola and the line passing through it? What can you deduce from this equation?\n7. How many values of $a$ satisfy the equation you derived in the previous step? Can you find those values?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios or mathematical situations where determining the intersection point(s) between a line and a curve is relevant? How does the thought process and steps involved in solving this problem apply to those scenarios?"
