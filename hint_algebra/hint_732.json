    "solution": "We don't know $g(x)$, so we don't have an expression we can simply stick $25$ in to get an answer. We do, however, know that $g(f(x)) =x^2 + x + 1$.  So, if we can figure out what to put into $f(x)$ such that $25$ is the resulting output, we can use our expression for $g(f(x))$ to find $g(25)$.\n\nIf $f(x) = 25$, then we have $3x^2 - 2 = 25$, so $x^2 = 9$, which means $x=3$ or $x=-3$.  Since $x$ could be $3$ or $-3$, we could have $g(25) = g(f(3))$ or $g(25) = g(f(-3))$.  Using the given expression for $g(f(x))$, the two possible values of $g(25)$ are  $g(f(3)) = 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 13$ and $g(f(-3)) = (-3)^2 + (-3) + 1 = 7$.  The sum of these is $13+7=\\boxed{20}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given function $f(x)$? Can you describe it in simple terms?\n2. If we substitute $f(x)$ into $g(f(x))$, what does the resulting expression look like?\n3. In the expression $g(f(x))$, what is the purpose of function $g$?\n4. What will the function $g(f(x))$ become if we substitute $3x^2-2$ into it?\n5. Can you simplify the expression $x^2+x+1$ obtained after substituting $f(x)$ into $g$?\n6. What is the value of $g(25)$? How can we find it by substituting $x = 25$ into the simplified expression?\n7. Are there any other values of $x$ that you could substitute into the simplified expression to find their corresponding $g(x)$ values?\n8. What are the possible values of $g(25)$? Can we find the sum of these values?"
