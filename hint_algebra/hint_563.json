    "problem": "For the graph of a certain quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, the vertex of the parabola is $(3,7)$ and one of the $x$-intercepts is $(-2,0)$.  What is the $x$-coordinate of the other $x$-intercept?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(3,7)$, the parabola is symmetric around the line $x = 3$.  Furthermore, the two $x$-intercepts of the parabola are also symmetric around this line.  One $x$-intercept is $(-2,0)$, whose distance from the line $x = 3$ is $3 - (-2) = 5$, so the other $x$-intercept is at $(3 + 5,0) = (8,0)$.  The $x$-coordinate of this $x$-intercept is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the significance of the vertex of a parabola and how it relates to the quadratic equation?\n2. Given that the vertex is (3,7) and one of the x-intercepts is (-2,0), what information can we gather about the quadratic equation?\n3. How can we determine the equation of a parabola when given the coordinates of the vertex and one point on the parabola?\n4. What is the general form of a quadratic equation and how can we relate it to the given information?\n5. Can you derive a formula or equation that relates the coordinates of the vertex with the coefficients of the quadratic equation?\n6. If we substitute the coordinates of the vertex into the equation, how can we use it to find the value of the coefficient 'a'?\n7. After finding the equation of the parabola, how can we find the x-coordinate of the other x-intercept?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios in which the given information about the vertex and one x-intercept can be used to find the other x-intercept?"
