    "problem": "Find the fifth term of the geometric sequence with first term $2$ and second term $\\frac{1}{4}$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common ratio is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{2}=\\frac{1}{8}$, so the $k^{th}$ term is $2\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{k-1}$. Thus we have:\n\n$2\\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^4=\\frac{2}{2^{12}}=\\frac{1}{2^{11}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2048}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a geometric sequence is? How is it different from an arithmetic sequence?\n2. What is the formula to find the nth term of a geometric sequence? How can we use this formula to find the fifth term?\n3. How can we determine the common ratio of a geometric sequence? What is the common ratio in this specific sequence?\n4. What does it mean for a sequence to have a common ratio less than 1? How does it affect the terms of the sequence?\n5. Can you use the formula for the nth term to find the fifth term directly? If not, what other information do you need?\n6. How can we find the fifth term if we know the first term and the common ratio?\n7. Is there another way to find the fifth term without using the formula for the nth term? If so, what is it and how does it work?\n8. Can you think of any real-life situations where geometric sequences are used or represented?\n9. What patterns do you notice when you compare the terms in this geometric sequence?\n10. How can we generalize the process for finding any term in a geometric sequence using the given information?"
