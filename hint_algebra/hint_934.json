    "problem": "The graph of a certain quadratic $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a parabola with vertex $(-4,0)$ which passes through the point $(1,-75)$.  What is the value of $a$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the vertex of the parabola is $(-4,0)$, the quadratic must be of the form $y = a(x + 4)^2$.  The parabola passes through the point $(1,-75)$, which gives us the equation $-75 = 25a$.  Hence, $a = -75/25 = \\boxed{-3}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the vertex of a parabola represents and its significance in this context?\n2. How can we use the given information about the vertex (-4,0) to determine a relationship between a, b, and c in the quadratic equation y = ax^2 + bx + c?\n3. Based on the information given, what can we deduce about the x-coordinate of the vertex? Why is this important?\n4. How can we use the point (1,-75) that the parabola passes through to find a specific equation representing the quadratic equation y = ax^2 + bx + c?\n5. What are the steps involved in substituting the x and y values from the point (1,-75) into the equation and finding the resulting equation? \n6. How can we manipulate the equation to isolate the value of parameter 'a' and solve for it?\n7. Do you notice any shortcuts, patterns, or alternative methods that could be used to find the value of 'a' in this specific scenario?\n8. Can you think of any real-world situations or mathematical problems where understanding the value of 'a' in a quadratic equation would be important or useful?"
