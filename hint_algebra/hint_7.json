    "problem": "If $3p+4q=8$ and $4p+3q=13$, what is $q$ equal to?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Because the question only asks for the value of $q$, we can begin by eliminating $p$. In order to do this, we multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3, giving us a system of two equations that both have 12 as the coefficient of $p$ \\begin{align*} 12p+16q&=32\n\\\\ 12p+9q&=39\n\\end{align*}From here, we can just subtract the second equation from the first. This gives us $(12p+16q)-(12p+9q)=32-(39)$, which simplifies to $7q=-7$ or $q=\\boxed{-1}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step you would take to solve this problem?\n2. Are there any different methods that you know of for solving a system of equations like this one? \n3.

Why is it necessary to isolate a variable before substituting it into the other equation? \n5. After substituting the variable, what does the resulting equation look like and how would you solve it? \n6. Can you think of any other types of equations that might require similar thinking and steps to solve?"
