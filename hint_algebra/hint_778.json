    "problem": "A point $(3\\sqrt{5},d+3)$ is $3d$ units away from the origin. What is the smallest possible value of $d$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "By the distance formula, the distance between the origin and $(3\\sqrt{5},d+3)$ is $\\sqrt{(3\\sqrt{5})^2+(d+3)^2}$. Setting this equal to $3d$, we have  \\begin{align*}\n9d^2&=(3\\sqrt{5})^2+(d+3)^2\\\\\n9d^2&=45+d^2+6d+9\\\\\n8d^2-6d-54&=0\\\\\n4d^2-3d-27&=0\\\\\n(4d+9)(d-3)&=0\n\\end{align*}Thus, the values of $d$ are $-\\frac{9}{4}$ and $3$. We find that $-\\frac{9}{4}$ is an extraneous answer (since distance cannot be negative), so our answer is $d=\\boxed{3}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the first step should be in solving this problem?\n2. How can we determine the distance between a point and the origin? Are there any formulas or methods that can help us?\n3. If we assume the point is $(x, y)$, how can we express the distance between the point and the origin in terms of $x$ and $y$?\n4. How can we use the given information, $(3\\sqrt{5}, d+3)$ being $3d$ units away from the origin, to set up an equation or inequality?\n5. How can we manipulate the equation or inequality to solve for $d$?\n6. Are there any restrictions or conditions on the possible values of $d$ in this problem? If so, how can we identify them?\n7. What is the range of possible values for $d$ based on the equation or inequality we derived?\n8. How can we determine the smallest possible value of $d$ from the range of solutions?\n9. Is there a geometric interpretation or intuition behind the solution for $d$ in this problem? If so, what is it?\n10. Can you think of any extension problems or variations where a similar approach or line of thinking could be applied?"
