    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the distance formula on each pair of points.\nFrom $A$ to $B$: $\\sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (8-2)^2} = 6$\nFrom $B$ to $C$: $\\sqrt{(5-1)^2 + (5-8)^2} = \\sqrt{16+9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$\nFrom $C$ to $A$: $\\sqrt{(5-1)^2 + (5-2)^2} = \\sqrt{16+9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$\nAdding the three side lengths of the triangle together, we get $6+5+5=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in finding the perimeter of a triangle with these given points? \n2. Are you familiar with the formula for calculating the distance between two points? If so, how can you apply it to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle? \n3. What are the coordinates of point A? How can you calculate the distance between points A and B? \n4. What are the coordinates of point B? How can you calculate the distance between points B and C? \n5. What are the coordinates of point C? How can you calculate the distance between points C and A? \n6. How can you add the lengths of the three sides of the triangle to find the perimeter? \n7. Can you think of any other situations where finding the perimeter of a figure might require similar steps and calculations?"
