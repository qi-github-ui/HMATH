    "problem": "If $h(x)$ is a function whose domain is $[-8,8]$, and $g(x)=h\\left(\\frac x2\\right)$, then the domain of $g(x)$ is an interval of what width?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since we defined $g(x) = h\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)$, a real number $x$ is in the domain of $g$ if and only if $\\frac{x}{2}$ is in the domain of $h$.  Therefore, the domain of $g$ consists of all $x$ such that $$-8\\le \\frac x2\\le 8.$$The solutions to this inequality are given by $-16\\le x\\le 16$, so the domain of $g$ is an interval of width $16 - (-16) = \\boxed{32}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define the concept of a function and its domain?\n2. Can you explain what it means for a function's domain to be [-8, 8]? What is the significance of these values?\n3. What does it mean for a function to have a composition with another function? Can you explain this concept with an example?\n4. How does the function $h(x)$ affect the input value of $x$ when we compose $g(x)$ as $h\\left(\\frac x2\\right)$?\n5. What does it mean for the domain of $g(x)$ to be an interval? How is this interval related to the domain of $h(x)$? \n6. To determine the domain of $g(x)$, what adjustments or transformations do we need to make to the original domain of $h(x)$?\n7. How does dividing $x$ by 2 in the composition $h\\left(\\frac x2\\right)$ affect the width of the interval that represents the domain of $g(x)$?\n8. Can you generalize the process of determining the domain of a composed function like $g(x)$ using different examples or functions?\n9. Are there any specific restrictions or conditions placed on the domain of $g(x)$ due to the composition with $h(x)$? If so, what are they?\n10. Can you think of any real-life scenarios where understanding the domain of a composed function would be useful?"
