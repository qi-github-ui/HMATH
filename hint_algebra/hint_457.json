    "problem": "A math teacher requires Noelle to do one homework assignment for each of the first five homework points she wants to earn; for each of the next five homework points, she needs to do two homework assignments; and so on, so that to earn the $n^{\\text{th}}$ homework point, she has to do $n\\div5$ (rounded up) homework assignments. For example, when she has 11 points, it will take $12\\div5=2.4\\rightarrow3$ homework assignments to earn her $12^{\\text{th}}$ point. What is the smallest number of homework assignments necessary to earn a total of 25 homework points?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Noelle only has to do 1 homework assignment to earn her first point, and the same is true for each of her first five points.  She must then do 2 homework assignments to earn her sixth point, seventh point, and so on, up to her tenth point.  Continuing, we see that Noelle must do a total of \\[1+1+1+1+1+2+2+2+2+2+\\dots+5+5+5+5+5\\] homework assignments to earn 25 points.\n\nThis sum may be rewritten as $5(1+2+3+4+5)=5(15)=\\boxed{75}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you understand the given problem and summarize what is being asked?\n2. How does the math teacher determine the number of homework assignments required for each homework point?\n3. Can you explain the pattern that the teacher is using to determine the number of homework assignments needed?\n4. If Noelle has earned 11 homework points, how many homework assignments does she need to do to earn her 12th point? How did you calculate that?\n5. Can you generalize the pattern for earning each subsequent homework point after 5, in terms of the number of homework assignments required?\n6. How many homework assignments are needed to earn a total of 25 homework points? Explain how you arrived at your answer.\n7. Can you think of other scenarios or examples where a similar pattern might be used to determine the number of assignments needed to achieve a certain goal?\n8. How would the problem change if the number of homework points needed for each subsequent set of homework assignments was different (e.g., instead of 5, it was 3)?"
