    "problem": "What is the degree of the polynomial $(4 +5x^3 +100 +2\\pi x^4 + \\sqrt{10}x^4 +9)$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "This polynomial is not written in standard form.  However, we don't need to write it in standard form, nor do we need to pay attention to the coefficients.  We just look for the exponents on $x$.  We have an $x^4$ term and no other term of higher degree, so $\\boxed{4}$ is the degree of the polynomial.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you identify the terms in the polynomial?\n2. How would you describe the degree of a polynomial?\n3. What is the highest power of x in the given polynomial? How did you determine that?\n4. Can you simplify the polynomial by combining like terms? What is the simplified form?\n5. How does the degree of a polynomial affect its behavior and properties?\n6. Can you think of any other polynomial and determine its degree using similar methods?"
