Can you substitute it into the definition of $f(x)$ and simplify the expression further?\n3. After evaluating $f(1)$, what is the resulting expression for $f(f(1))$? How did you compute it?\n4. By applying the function composition process, what is the expression for $f(f(f(1)))$? Can you simplify it further?\n5. Continuing with this pattern, what is the expression for $f(f(f(f(1))))$? How did you arrive at that result?\n6. Finally, substitute the value of $f(f(f(f(1))))$ into the definition of $f(x)$ and compute the overall expression. What is the final result of $f(f(f(f(f(1)))))$?"
