    "problem": "What is the largest three-digit integer whose digits are distinct and form a geometric sequence?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If we can find such a number whose hundreds digit is 9, then this number will be greater than any with a hundreds digit lower than 9. We want the common ratio to be as small as possible, so that the other digits are as large as possible. If $r$ is the common ratio, then the ones digit is $\\frac{9}{r^2}$. One might therefore expect that $r$ has a $3$ in its numerator. We could set $r=3$ for $931$. But $r=\\frac{3}{2}$ also works and is actually smaller, giving $\\boxed{964}$.\n\n(Note that $r=1$ would not give distinct digits, and $r<1$ would make the ones digit too large.)",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is a geometric sequence? Can you provide an example?\n2. How does the condition \"distinct digits\" affect the possible values for the geometric sequence?\n3. How can we determine the general form of a three-digit number with distinct digits and a geometric sequence?\n4. What is the maximum value that the first term of the geometric sequence can have to satisfy the condition of a three-digit number?\n5. How can we find the second and third terms of the geometric sequence based on the first term?\n6. By substituting the values into the formula for the three-digit number, can you determine the maximum three-digit integer that satisfies the given conditions?\n7. Are there any other restrictions or requirements that we need to consider in finding the largest three-digit integer with distinct digits and a geometric sequence?\n8. Can you think of any other similar problems or scenarios where examining the properties of a sequence can help us find a maximum or minimum value?"
