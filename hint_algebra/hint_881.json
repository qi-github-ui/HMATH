    "problem": "Jo adds up all the positive integers from 1 to 100. Kate does a similar thing with the first 100 positive integers; however, she first rounds every integer to its nearest multiple of 10 (rounding 5s up) and then adds the 100 values. What is the positive difference between Jo's sum and Kate's sum?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Consider the numbers $1, 2, 3,..., 10$. Jo would add these integers up as is, while Kate would round the first four down to 0, decreasing her sum by $1+2+3+4=10$, and would round the last six up to 10, increasing her sum by $5+4+3+2+1+0=15$. Thus, her sum is $-10+15=5$ more than Jo's sum for the numbers $1, 2, 3,..., 10$. This same logic applies to the numbers $11, 12, 13,..., 20$ also, and in general it applies to every ten numbers greater than 20. Since there are ten sets of ten numbers from 1 to 100, Kate's sum is $10 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{50}$ more than Jo's sum.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the process Jo follows to add up all the positive integers from 1 to 100?\n2. How does Kate's process differ from Jo's when adding up the first 100 positive integers? Can you describe Kate's rounding method?\n3. If Jo's sum is denoted as J and Kate's sum as K, can you write an algebraic expression for Jo's sum?\n4. Can you write an algebraic expression for Kate's sum based on her rounding method?\n5. How would you compute Jo's sum using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series?\n6. How would you compute Kate's sum using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, considering her rounding method?\n7. Can you evaluate Jo's sum and Kate's sum using the formulas derived in the previous questions?\n8. What is the positive difference between Jo's sum and Kate's sum? How can you determine this mathematically?\n9. How does the rounding method impact the positive difference between the two sums?\n10. Can you think of any other scenarios where rounding to the nearest multiple of 10 might affect the sum in a similar way?"
