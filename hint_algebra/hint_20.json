    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We need some basic facts from number theory: $a^0 = 1$ for any $a,$ $1^b = 1$ for any $b,$ and $(-1)^c = 1$ if $c$ is an even integer. Unless the base is a complex number (which is excluded since we are looking for integer solutions), there are no other ways to get an RHS of $1.$ Thus, either the exponent is zero $($giving the equation $25 - x^2 = 0),$ the base is $1$ $($giving $x -2 = 1),$ or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is even $($giving the simultaneous equations $x - 2 = -1$ and $25 - x^2 = 2n$ for some integer $n).$ Solving the first equation gives $x = \\pm 5,$ and solving the second gives $x = 3.$ The third equation implies that $x = 1,$ in which case $25 - x^2 = 24$ is indeed even, so $x = 1$ is a valid solution. In all, there are $\\boxed{4}$ integer solutions.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you simplify the equation $(x-2)^{(25-x^2)}=1$ to a more understandable form?\n2. What does it mean for a number raised to the power of another number to equal 1?\n3. Are there any restrictions on the values that $(x-2)$ and $(25-x^2)$ can take for the equation to hold true?\n4. Can you identify any particularly simple or special cases of the equation where it is easier to find the solutions?\n5. How does the exponent $(25-x^2)$ affect the potential solutions of the equation? Can you make any observations about it?\n6. Are there any specific values of $(x-2)$ that result in non-integer powers? If so, how does it impact the number of integer solutions to the equation?\n7. How can you systematically analyze the possible integer solutions, taking into account the impact of both $(x-2)$ and $(25-x^2)$?"
