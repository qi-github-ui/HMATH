    "solution": "We have that \\begin{align*} f(x) - g(x) &= (3x^2-2x+ 4) - (x^2-kx-6) \\\\ &= 2x^2 + (k-2)\\cdot x +10. \\end{align*}So $f(10) - g(10) = 2\\cdot 10^2 + (k - 2)\\cdot 10 +10 = 10.$ Thus $-2\\cdot 10^2 = (k-2)\\cdot 10,$ and $k = \\boxed{-18}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does the expression $f(10)$ represent? Can you explain its meaning in the context of the function $f(x)$?\n2. Similarly, what does the expression $g(10)$ represent? Can you explain its meaning in the context of the function $g(x)$?\n3. If we substitute $x=10$ into the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, what do we get? Can you simplify the expressions?\n4. Given that $f(10) - g(10) = 10$, what can we infer about the values of $f(10)$ and $g(10)$?\n5. Using the information obtained from the previous question, what equation can we set up to find the value of $k$?\n6. How can we simplify the equation obtained in the previous question? What steps can we take to isolate the variable $k$?\n7. After simplifying and solving the equation, what is the final value of $k$?"
