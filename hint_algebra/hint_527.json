    "problem": "Evaluate $\\lfloor-2.54\\rfloor+\\lceil25.4\\rceil$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The greatest integer less than $-2.54$ is $-3$; the smallest integer greater than $25.4$ is $26$. So $\\lfloor -2.54 \\rfloor + \\lceil 25.4 \\rceil = -3+26=\\boxed{23}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you explain the concept of evaluating expressions involving the floor and ceiling functions?\n2. What is the definition of the floor function? How does it work with positive and negative numbers?\n3. What is the definition of the ceiling function? In what scenarios is it useful?\n4. Why would we need to consider the floor and ceiling functions when evaluating an expression like this?\n5. How would you calculate the floor of -2.54? What about the ceiling of 25.4?\n6. After calculating the individual values, what would be the next step in evaluating the expression?\n7. How do you combine the floor and ceiling values to obtain the final result?\n8.
