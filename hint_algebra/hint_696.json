    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "To solve for $x$, we wish to eliminate $y$. Multiply the first equation by $2$ and add it to the second: \\begin{align*}\n(4x-2y) + (x+2y) &= 10+5\\\\\n5x &= 15\\\\\nx &= \\boxed{3}\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you identify any key information from the given equations regarding the values of x and y?\n2. How does the first equation relate to the second equation?
