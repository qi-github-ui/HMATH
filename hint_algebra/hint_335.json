    "problem": "If $\\displaystyle\\frac{m}{n} = 15$, $\\displaystyle\\frac{p}{n} = 3$, and $\\displaystyle \\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{1}{10}$, then what is $\\displaystyle\\frac{m}{q}$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If we multiply the first equation, the third equation, and the reciprocal of the second equation, we get \\[\\frac{m}{n}\\cdot\\frac{p}{q}\\cdot \\frac{n}{p} = 15\\cdot \\frac{1}{10}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}\\Rightarrow \\frac{m}{q}= \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\]",
