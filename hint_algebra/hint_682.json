    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Observe first that $x=0$ is not a solution to the equation since it makes the denominator of $\\frac{1}{2x}$ equal to 0.  For $x\\neq 0$, we may multiply both sides by both denominators and move all the resulting terms to the left-hand side to get $2x^2-2rx+7=0$. Observe that there are two ways the original equation could have exactly one solution.  Either $2x^2-2rx+7=0$ has two solutions and one of them is 0, or else $2x^2-2rx+7=0$ has exactly one nonzero solution.  By trying $x=0$, we rule out the first possibility.\n\nConsidering the expression $\\frac{-b\\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the solutions of $ax^2+bx+c=0$, we find that there is exactly one solution if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is zero.  Setting $(-2r)^2-4(2)(7)$ equal to 0 gives $4r^2-4(14) = 0$.  Add 4(14) and divide by 4 to find $r^2=14$.  The two solutions of this equation are $\\sqrt{14}$ and $-\\sqrt{14}$, and their product is $\\boxed{-14}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for an equation to have exactly one real solution?\n2. What does it imply about the roots of the equation if we have the product of all real values of r?\n3. If we have the equation $\\frac{1}{2x}=\\frac{r-x}{7}$, what do you think would be the first step in solving it?\n4. How would you determine the conditions under which the given equation has exactly one real solution?\n5. What values of r would make the denominator of the equation equal to zero? How does this impact the existence of solutions?\n6. How does the relationship between the numerator and denominator impact the possibility of having multiple solutions?\n7. Can you think of any other equations where the product of all real values leads to a specific condition on the number of solutions?"
