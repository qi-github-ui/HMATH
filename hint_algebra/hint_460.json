    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $2>0$ we know that $f(2)=a(2)+3=5$. Solving for $a$, we get that $a=1$. With $x=0$, we get that $f(0)=ab=5$. We already know that $a=1$, so $b=5$. Because -2 is negative, we know that $f(-2)=b(-2)+c=(5)(-2)+c=-10$. This tells us that $c=0$, so our answer is $a+b+c=1+5+0=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the function f(x) represents and how it is defined for different values of x?\n2. Based on the given information, what can you infer about the value of f(x) when x > 0?\n3. What can you conclude about the value of f(x) when x = 0 based on the given information?\n4. Based on the given information, what can you deduce about the value of f(x) when x < 0?\n5. With the information f(2) = 5, f(0) = 5, and f(-2) = -10, can you derive any equations or conditions involving a, b, and c?\n6. How can you use the information from the previous question to determine the values of a, b, and c?\n7. Considering that a, b, and c are nonnegative integers, what possibilities exist for the values of a, b, and c?\n8. Can you narrow down the possible values of a, b, and c further using the given information and the constraints on a, b, and c?\n9. What is the final value of a + b + c based on your deductions and reasoning?"
