    "problem": "If $f(x)=\\sqrt{x-3}$, what is the smallest real number $x$ in the domain of $f(f(x))$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Note that $f(x)$ is defined if and only if $x\\ge 3$.\n\nThus $f(f(x)) = f(\\sqrt{x-3})$ is defined if and only if $$\\sqrt{x-3}\\ge 3.$$ This is true if and only if $$x-3\\ge 3^2,$$ or equivalently, if $x\\ge 12$. So the smallest real number for which $f(f(x))$ is defined is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the function $f(x)=\\sqrt{x-3}$ represents and its domain?\n2. When we calculate $f(f(x))$, what do we need to do first? \n3. What does $f(f(x))$ mean in terms of the original function $f(x)$? \n4. Can you find the expressions for $f(f(x))$ by substituting $f(x)$ into the function $f(x)$? \n5. What constraints do we have for the domain of $f(f(x))$ based on the original function's domain? \n6. How can we determine the smallest real number $x$ that satisfies the domain requirements for $f(f(x))$?"
