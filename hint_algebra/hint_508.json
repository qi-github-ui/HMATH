    "problem": "Solve for $x$, where $x>0$ and $5x^2+9x-18=0$. Express your answer as a simplified common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$5x^2+9x-18$ can be written as $(5x-6)(x+3)$. Because $x$ must be positive, the only factor that can be considered is $(5x-6)$. Therefore: \\begin{align*}\n5x-6&=0\\\\\n5x&=6\\\\\nx&=\\boxed{\\frac{6}{5}}\n\\end{align*}",
