    "problem": "Find the largest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $|x-5|=12$.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can split the expression $|x-5|=12$ into two separate cases: $x-5=12$ and $x-5=-12$. For the first case, solving for $x$ would give us $x=12+5=17$. For the second case, we would get $x=-12+5=-7$. Therefore, $x=17$ and $x=-7$ both satisfy the equation. Since the problem asks for the largest value of $x$, our solution is $\\boxed{17}$.",
