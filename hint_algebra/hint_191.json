    "problem": "What is the tenth term in the geometric sequence $9,3,1,\\frac 13, \\ldots$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We could write out all of the terms until we get to the tenth term, but instead we can find the formula for the $n$th term in the geometric sequence. Since 9 is the first term and we multiply by $\\frac{1}{3}$ to find the next term, we determine that the formula for the geometric sequence is $a_n=9\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{(n-1)}$. That means $a_{10}=9\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^9=\\frac{3^2}{3^9}=\\frac{1}{3^7}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2187}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what a geometric sequence is?\n2. What is the common ratio between consecutive terms in this sequence?\n3. How would you determine the value of the tenth term in the sequence?\n4. Are there any patterns or formulas that can help us find the value of any term in a geometric sequence?\n5. Can you compute the value of the tenth term using the common ratio and the first term? If so, what is it?\n6. Is there a way to check if your answer is correct? How would you verify that the value you obtained for the tenth term is accurate?\n7. Can you generalize this process to find the nth term in any geometric sequence? How would you determine its value?\n8. Are there any other methods or techniques that could be used to find the tenth term in a geometric sequence?\n9. Are there any special properties or characteristics of geometric sequences that could be helpful in solving this problem?\n10. Can you think of any real-life situations or applications where knowledge of geometric sequences might be useful?"
