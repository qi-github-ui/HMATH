Given that $a = -2$ and $b = 3$, what is the value of $a(b + 1) + ab$?\n4. Can you substitute the given values into the expression and calculate the final result?\n5. Is there any other way to represent the expression $a(b + 1) + ab$ without using parentheses?\n6. Can you think of any other values for $a$ and $b$ that would result in a different value for $a(b + 1) + ab$?"
