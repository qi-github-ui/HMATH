    "problem": "What is the $x$-coordinate of the point on the $x$-axis that is equidistant from points $A( -2, 0)$ and $B(0,4)$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Because the point for which we are looking is on the $x$-axis, we know that it is of the form $(x, 0)$. We apply the distance formula. The distance from A is  \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(-2-x)^2+(0-0)^2} &= \\sqrt{x^2+4x+4}\n\\end{align*} The distance from B is  \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(0-x)^2 + (4-0)^2} &= \\sqrt{x^2+16}\n\\end{align*} Because the point is equidistant from A and B, we set the two distances equal: $x^2+4x+4 = x^2 + 16$. Simplifying gives us $4x = 12$, or $x = \\boxed{3}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe how you would approach finding the $x$-coordinate of the point on the $x$-axis that is equidistant from points $A(-2, 0)$ and $B(0, 4)$? \n2. Are there any particular strategies or formulas that come to mind when trying to find the distance between two points? \n3. How would you find the distances from point $A$ and point $B$ to a general point $(x, 0)$ on the $x$-axis? \n4. What does it mean for a point to be equidistant from two other points? \n5. Can you set up an equation or a condition that represents the given problem? \n6. How would you solve the equation or condition you set up in the previous question? \n7. What solution(s) did you find for the equation or condition, and do they make sense in the context of the problem? \n8. Can you think of any real-life scenarios where finding an equidistant point on the $x$-axis between two given points would be useful?"
