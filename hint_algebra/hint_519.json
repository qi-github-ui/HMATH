    "solution": "The graph of the parabola is shown below:\n\n[asy]\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(6);\n\nxaxis(-2.5,.75,Ticks(f, 1.0));\n\nyaxis(-5,8,Ticks(f, 2.0));\nreal f(real x)\n\n{\n\nreturn 4x^2+7x-1;\n\n}\n\ndraw(graph(f,-2.5,.75));\ndot((.5,3.5));\ndot((-.5,-3.5));\nlabel(\"$A$\", (.5,3.5), E);\nlabel(\"$B$\", (-.5,-3.5), E);\n[/asy]\n\nLet the coordinates of point $A$ be $(x,y)$. Then since the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is the origin, the coordinates of $B$ are $(-x,-y)$. Both of these points must lie on the parabola, so we plug them into the equation for the parabola to get the equations \\begin{align*}\ny&=4x^2+7x-1,\\\\\n-y&=4(-x)^2+7(-x)-1 \\Rightarrow y=-4x^2+7x+1.\n\\end{align*}Setting the two equations equal to eliminate $y$, we have $4x^2+7x-1=-4x^2+7x+1$, or $8x^2=2\\Rightarrow x^2=\\frac{1}{4}$. So $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ (the negative alternative for $x$ gives the same answer) and $y=4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2+7\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)-1=\\frac{7}{2}$. Thus, point $A$ is at $(1/2,7/2)$ and point $B$ is at $(-1/2,-7/2)$. The length of $\\overline{AB}$ is then $\\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(-\\frac{7}{2}-\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2}=\\sqrt{50}$. Hence, $AB^2=\\boxed{50}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we find the coordinates of points A and B on the parabola?\n2. What equation represents the fact that the origin is the midpoint of line segment AB?\n3. If the coordinates of point A are (x\u2081, y\u2081) and the coordinates of point B are (x\u2082, y\u2082), what is the midpoint formula for finding the coordinates of the midpoint?\n4. Substituting the coordinates of the midpoint and the equation of the parabola into the midpoint formula, can we solve for x\u2081 and x\u2082?\n5. Once we have the x-coordinates of points A and B, how can we find the corresponding y-coordinates?\n6. What does the length of line segment AB represent geometrically?\n7. How do we find the length of line segment AB given its coordinates?\n8. What is the equation for the length of a line segment given its endpoints' coordinates?\n9.
