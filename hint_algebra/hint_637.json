    "problem": "Luke is borrowing $\\$10{,}000$ from the bank. The bank offers him a choice between two $10$-year payment plans:\n\n${\\bf Plan~1.}$  Luke's debt accumulates $10\\%$ annual interest which compounds quarterly. Luke pays off half his balance after $5$ years, and the rest at the end of the $10$ years.\n\n${\\bf Plan~2.}$  Luke's debt accumulates $10\\%$ annual interest which compounds annually. Luke pays off his full balance at the end of the $10$ years.\n\nWhat is the (positive) difference between Luke's total payments under Plan 1 and his total payments under Plan 2? Round to the nearest dollar.",

    "solution": "For Plan 1, we use the formula $A=P\\left(1+\\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}$, where $A$ is the end balance, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate, $t$ is the number of years, and $n$ is the number of times compounded in a year.\n\nFirst we find out how much he would owe in $5$ years. $$A=\\$10,\\!000\\left(1+\\frac{0.1}{4}\\right)^{4 \\cdot 5} \\approx \\$16,\\!386.16$$He pays off half of it in $5$ years, which is $\\frac{\\$16,\\!386.16}{2}=\\$8,\\!193.08$ He has $\\$8,\\!193.08$ left to be compounded over the next $5$ years. This then becomes $$\\$8,\\!193.08\\left(1+\\frac{0.1}{4}\\right)^{4 \\cdot 5} \\approx \\$13,\\!425.32$$He has to pay back a total of $\\$8,\\!193.08+\\$13,\\!425.32=\\$21,\\!618.40$ in ten years if he chooses Plan 1.\n\nWith Plan 2, he would have to pay $\\$10,000\\left(1+0.1\\right)^{10} \\approx \\$25,\\!937.42$ in $10$ years.\n\nTherefore, he should choose Plan 1 and save $25,\\!937.42-21,\\!618.40=4319.02 \\approx \\boxed{4319 \\text{ dollars}}$.",
