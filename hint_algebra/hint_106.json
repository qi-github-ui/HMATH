    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In order for the expression to have a domain of all real numbers, the quadratic $x^2+bx+8 = 0$ must have no real roots.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $b^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 8 = b^2 - 32$.  The quadratic has no real roots if and only if the discriminant is negative, so $b^2 - 32 < 0$, or $b^2 < 32$.  The greatest integer $b$ that satisfies this inequality is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the domain of a function represents?\n2. How can we determine the domain of a rational function?\n3. What are the restrictions on the denominator of a rational function?\n4. What is the denominator in the given expression? Can you factorize it?\n5. How does factoring the denominator help us determine the domain?\n6. If the factored form of the denominator includes linear factors, what are the restrictions on those factors?\n7. What does it mean for the expression to have a domain of all real numbers?\n8. How can we determine the values of $b$ that satisfy the conditions for the domain?\n9. What happens if we set the denominator equal to zero? Can you solve that equation?\n10. How does solving for the values of $b$ based on the restrictions help us find the greatest integer value of $b$?"
