    "solution": "We can split the expression $|x-3|=2x+4$ into two separate cases. In the first case, \\begin{align*} x-3&=2x+4\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad -x&=7\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=-7\n\\end{align*}However if we plug this value of $x$ back into the original equation $|x-3|=2x+4$, we get that $|-7-3|=2(-7)+4$ or $10=-10$. Since this is clearly not a valid statement, the first case gives us no possible solutions.\n\nIn the second case, \\begin{align*} x-3&=-(2x+4)\n\\\\ x-3&=-2x-4\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad 3x&=-1\n\\\\\\Rightarrow \\qquad x&=-\\frac13.\n\\end{align*}If we plug $-\\frac13$ back into the initial equation, we get that $\\left|-\\frac13-3\\right|=2\\left(-\\frac13\\right)+4$ which simplifies to $\\frac{10}{3}=\\frac{10}{3}$. Since this is true, we can accept $x=-\\frac13$ as a valid solution to the equation. Therefore, the only value of $x$ that satisfies the given equation is $\\boxed{-\\frac13}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain in your own words what the equation $|x-3|=2x+4$ means geometrically?\n2. What are the possible cases for the absolute value expression $|x-3|$? In each case, what would the equation $|x-3|=2x+4$ look like?\n3. If $x-3$ is positive, what does the equation $|x-3|=2x+4$ simplify to? And if $x-3$ is negative, what does the equation become?\n4. For the case when $x-3$ is positive, how can you solve $x-3=2x+4$ algebraically to find a potential solution?\n5. If $x-3$ is negative, can you set up and solve an equation similar to step 4 to find another potential solution?\n6. Are there any extraneous solutions that you need to check and exclude? How can you verify whether the solutions satisfy the original equation?\n7. Can you simplify the solutions to their simplest fractional form?\n8. Are there any other types of equations where you can apply similar reasoning and steps?"
