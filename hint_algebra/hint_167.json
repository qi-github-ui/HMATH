    "problem": "Let $a\\star b = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{a+b}}{\\sqrt{a-b}}$. If $ x \\star 24 = 7$, find $x$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that $x\\star24=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x+24}}{\\sqrt{x-24}}=7$. Because we cannot take the square root of a negative number and because the denominator of a fraction cannot be zero, we know that $x-24>0$. Thus, a reasonable guess for $x$ would be $x=25$. $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{25+24}}{\\sqrt{25-24}}=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{49}}{\\sqrt{1}}=7$, as desired, so our answer is indeed $x=\\boxed{25}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of the operation $\\star$?\n2. What are the values of $a$ and $b$ in the expression $a \\star b$ in this particular problem?\n3. What does it mean for $x \\star 24$ to equal 7? How can we interpret this equation?\n4. How can we isolate the variable $x$ in the equation $x \\star 24 = 7$? What steps should we take?\n5. What happens to the expression $x \\star 24$ as we perform the necessary calculations to isolate $x$?\n6. How do the radicals in the expression $\\sqrt{a+b}$ and $\\sqrt{a-b}$ affect the value of $x$ in the equation $x \\star 24 = 7$?\n7. Once we have isolated $x$, how can we check our answer to ensure it is correct?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios where a similar method of thinking and steps might be used to solve equations?"
