    "problem": "Given the function $y=x^2+10x+21$, what is the least possible value of $y$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "When graphed, this function is a parabola that opens upwards. Thus, the minimum possible value of y occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The $x$ coordinate of the vertex is $\\frac{-b}{2a}$. Substituting the given values, this yields $\\frac{-10}{2}=-5$. Substituting this for $x$ gives the minimum value of $y$ to be \\begin{align*}\ny&=x^2+10x+21 \\\\\n&=(-5)^2+10(-5)+21 \\\\\n&=25+(-50)+21 \\\\\n&=25-50+21 \\\\\n&=-25+21 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{-4}\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the process of finding the least possible value of y for this function?\n2. Are there any specific strategies or methods that you would consider using to find the least value of y?\n3. How can the structure of the quadratic function help us determine the minimum value of y?\n4. What are the characteristics or properties of a quadratic function that can help identify its minimum value?\n5. Is it possible to find the minimum value without graphing the function? If so, how?\n6. Can you explain the significance of the term \"least possible value\"? How does it relate to the concept of a minimum?"
