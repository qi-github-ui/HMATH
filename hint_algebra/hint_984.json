    "problem": "Two lines defined by the equations $y = mx + 4$ and $y = 3x + b$, where $m$ and $b$ are constants, intersect at the point $(6, 10)$. What is the value of $b + m$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the two lines intersect at $(6,10)$, each must pass through that point.  So, we can substitute this point for $x$ and $y$ in the two given equations, then solve for $m$ and $b$.  In the first equation we find: \\begin{align*}\n10&=m(6)+4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6&=6m\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 1&=m\n\\end{align*} Using the same method in the second equation gives: \\begin{align*}\n10&=3(6)+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 10&=18+b\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -8&=b\n\\end{align*} The value of $b+m$ is equal to $1+(-8)=\\boxed{-7}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How do you determine the point of intersection between two lines given their equations?\n2. What information does the point of intersection $(6, 10)$ provide us about the two lines?\n3. Can you express the equations $y = mx + 4$ and $y = 3x + b$ in a form that allows us to find their intersection point more easily?\n4. Using the point $(6, 10)$, can you substitute the values into the equations $y = mx + 4$ and $y = 3x + b$ to find the values of $m$ and $b$?\n5. Once you find the values of $m$ and $b$, how can you calculate the value of $b + m$?"
