    "solution": "This is a geometric sequence with first term $1$ and common ratio $\\frac{1}{3}$. Thus the sum of the first $n$ terms is: $$\\frac{121}{81}=\\frac{1\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n\\right]}{1-\\frac{1}{3}}=\\frac{3^n-1}{2\\cdot 3^{n-1}}.$$Solving we have: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{3^n-1}{2\\cdot 3^{n-1}} &= \\frac{121}{81}\\\\\n\\frac{3^n-1}{2\\cdot 3^n} &= \\frac{121}{243}\\\\\n243(3^n - 1) &= 121\\cdot2\\cdot 3^n\\\\\n243\\cdot 3^n - 243 &= 242\\cdot 3^n\\\\\n3^n&= 243\\\\\nn&= \\boxed{5}.\n\\end{align*}",
