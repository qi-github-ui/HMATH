    "problem": "The sum of the first $20$ positive even integers is also the sum of four consecutive even integers. What is the largest of these four integers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is $2 + 4 + \\dots + 40 = 2 (1 + 2 + \\dots + 20)$.  For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \\dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $2 (1 + 2 + \\dots + 20) = 20 \\cdot 21 = 420$.\n\nLet the four consecutive even integers be $n - 6$, $n - 4$, $n - 2$, and $n$.  Their sum is $4n - 12 = 420$, so $n = \\boxed{108}$.",
