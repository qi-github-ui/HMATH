    "problem": "If a regular polygon has a total of nine diagonals, how many sides does it have?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Given the number of sides of a polygon, $n$, the number of diagonals is given by $D=\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$.  To find the number of sides given the number of diagonals, we can solve this equation for $n$. \\begin{align*}D&=\\frac{n(n-3)}{2} \\\\ 2D&=n^2-3n \\\\ 0&=n^2-3n-2D.\\end{align*}  Then, using the quadratic formula we have $n=\\frac{3\\pm\\sqrt{3^2-4(1)(-2D)}}{2(1)}=\\frac{3\\pm\\sqrt{9+8D}}{2}$.\n\nSince we are given that $D=9$, we have $n=\\frac{3\\pm\\sqrt{9+8(9)}}{2}=\\frac{3\\pm9}{2}=-3\\text{ or }6$.  Since we must have a positive number of sides, a polygon with nine diagonals has $\\boxed{6}$ sides.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what a diagonal is in the context of a polygon?\n2. How many sides does a regular polygon with n sides have?\n3. How many diagonals are there in a regular polygon with n sides?\n4. If a regular polygon has a total of nine diagonals, what equation can we set up to represent this relationship?\n5. How can we solve the equation to find the value of n, representing the number of sides? Which method(s) could we use?\n6. If we find the value of n to be greater than or equal to 3, does it make sense in the context of a polygon? Why or why not?\n7. Based on the equation and reasoning, what is the value of n? How does it relate to the number of sides a regular polygon with nine diagonals has?\n8. Can you think of any other situations or problems where we can utilize similar thinking and steps to find the desired solution?"
