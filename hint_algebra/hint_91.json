    "problem": "What is the value of $b$ if $-x^2+bx-5<0$ only when $x\\in (-\\infty, 1)\\cup(5,\\infty)$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "When $x<1$ or $x>5$, $-x^2+bx-5<0$. That means that $-x^2+bx-5=0$ at $x=1$ and $x=5$. So, the parabola has roots at 1 and 5, giving us $(x-1)(x-5)=0$. However, we also know the parabola opens downwards since the coefficient of $x^2$ is negative, so we have to negate one of the factors. We can now write $-x^2+bx-5=(1-x)(x-5)=-x^2+6x-5$. Thus, $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the relationship between the values of $b$ and the inequality $-x^2 + bx - 5 < 0$ only holding true when $x$ is in the interval $(-\\infty, 1)\\cup(5,\\infty)$?\n2. How does changing the value of $b$ affect the shape and position of the graph of the quadratic function $-x^2 + bx - 5$?\n3. Can you explain the significance of the inequality $-x^2 + bx - 5 < 0$ in terms of the graph of the quadratic function?\n4. How would you go about finding the value of $b$ that satisfies the given condition? What steps or methods would you use?\n5. Are there any other intervals for $x$ where the inequality $-x^2 + bx - 5 < 0$ holds true? If so, what is the relationship between those intervals and the value of $b$?\n6. Can you think of any other quadratic inequalities where a specific value of $b$ is required to satisfy a certain condition? How would you approach solving those inequalities using critical thinking and steps similar to this example?"
