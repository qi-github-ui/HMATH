    "problem": "Simplify the fraction by rationalizing the denominator: $$\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{108}+2\\sqrt{12}+2\\sqrt{27}}.$$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, we can write $\\sqrt{108}=6\\sqrt{3}$, $2\\sqrt{12}=4\\sqrt{3}$ and $2\\sqrt{27}=6\\sqrt{3}$.  Substituting these, the expression becomes: $$\\frac{4}{6\\sqrt{3}+4\\sqrt{3}+6\\sqrt3}=\\frac{4}{16\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{3}}=\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}}$$",
