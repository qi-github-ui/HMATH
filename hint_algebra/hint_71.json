    "solution": "We have two inequalities which $c$ must satisfy. We consider these inequalities one at a time.\n\nThe first inequality is $\\frac{c}{3}\\le 2+c$. Multiplying both sides by $3$, we have $$c\\le 6+3c.$$Subtracting $3c$ from both sides gives $$-2c\\le 6.$$We can divide both sides by $-2$, but we must reverse the inequality since $-2$ is negative. This gives $c\\ge -3$.\n\nThe second inequality is $2+c < -2(1+c)$. Expanding the right side, we have $$2+c < -2-2c.$$Adding $2c-2$ to both sides gives $$3c<-4.$$Dividing both sides by $3$ gives $c<-\\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nSo, all $c$ which satisfy both inequalities are given by $-3\\le c<-\\frac{4}{3}$, or, in interval notation, $c\\in\\boxed{\\left[-3,-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you rewrite the given inequality in a different form that might make it easier to work with?\n2. How can we simplify the expressions on both sides of the inequality to make it easier to compare?\n3. What steps can we take to isolate the variable 'c' in the inequality?\n4. What effect does multiplying or dividing the inequality by negative numbers have on the inequality sign?\n5. How can we express the solution to the inequality using interval notation?\n6. Can we simplify any fractions that appear in our final answer? If so, how?\n7. Are there any values of 'c' that make the inequality false? If so, how can we determine those values?\n8. Can you think of any other types of inequalities that might require similar steps and thinking to solve?"
