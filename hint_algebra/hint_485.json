    "problem": "What non-zero, real value of $x$ satisfies $(5x)^4= (10x)^3$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "It may be easier to work with this if we leave both sides in somewhat factored form: \\begin{align*}\n(5x)^4&=(10x)^3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 5^4 x^4&=10^3 x^3\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 5^4 x^4&=5^3 2^3 x^3\n\\end{align*} Since $x$ is non-zero, we can cancel the common factor of $x^3$: $$\\Rightarrow\\qquad 5^4 x=5^3 2^3$$ Now, cancel $5^3$: \\begin{align*}\n5x&=8\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x&=\\boxed{\\frac{8}{5}}\n\\end{align*}",

Are you familiar with any properties or rules of exponents that could be applied in this situation? How might you use them to simplify the equation?\n3. If you raise both sides of the equation to a certain exponent, can you make the equation easier to solve? If so, what exponent would you choose and why?\n4. Can you think of any way to rewrite the equation so that it becomes a linear equation? How would you go about doing that?\n5. Once you have a linear equation, what would be the most appropriate method to solve for the value of x? Why do you think this method would be effective in this case?\n6. How would you verify your solution for x? What steps would you take to confirm that the value you obtained satisfies the original equation?"
