    "problem": "Compute the domain of the function  $$f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\lfloor x^2-7x+13\\rfloor}.$$",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The discriminant of the quadratic is $7^2-4(13)=-3<0$, so the quadratic has no real roots and is always positive for real inputs.  The function is undefined if $0\\leq x^2-7x+13<1$, since $\\lfloor x^2-7x+13 \\rfloor = 0$ in that case. Since the quadratic is always positive, we consider the inequality $x^2-7x+13<1$.\n\nTo find when $x^2-7x+13=1$, subtract 1 from both sides to obtain $x^2-7x+12=0$ and factor as $(x-3)(x-4)=0$, so $x=3$ or $x=4$.  The parabola $x^2-7x+12$ is negative between these points, so we must exclude the interval $(3,4)$ from the domain. So the domain of $f$ is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,3] \\cup [4,\\infty)}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the function represents and what its purpose is?\n2. What are the possible values for the expression inside the absolute value function, i.e., for the quantity x^2 - 7x + 13?\n3. What does the absolute value function do to the expression inside it? How does it affect the range of possible values?\n4. What happens if the expression inside the absolute value function equals zero? How does it affect the function?\n5. Can you find the values of x for which the expression inside the absolute value function is negative? How does it affect the function?\n6. What is the relationship between the domain of the function and the values that make the expression inside the absolute value function undefined?\n7. Can you summarize the domain of the function based on the range of possible values for the expression inside the absolute value function?\n8. Can you think of any other functions where determining the domain involves similar considerations and steps?"
