    "problem": "I randomly pick an integer $p$ between $1$ and $10$ inclusive. What is the probability that I choose a $p$ such that there exists an integer $q$ so that $p$ and $q$ satisfy the equation $pq - 4p - 2q = 2$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "We approach this problem by trying to find solutions to the equation $pq - 4p - 2q = 2$. To do this, we can use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and add $8$ to both sides to get $pq - 4p - 2q + 8 = 10$. This can be factored into $$(p-2)(q-4)=10$$  We now can see that there are solutions only if $p-2$ divides $10$. Thus, there are $4$ possible values of $p$ between $1$ and $10$ inclusive $(1,3,4 \\text{ and } 7)$. It follows that the probability of picking such a $p$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean for an integer p to satisfy the equation pq - 4p - 2q = 2?\n2. Can p and q both be positive integers? If so, how does this impact the possible values of p?\n3. Can p and q both be negative integers? If so, how does this impact the possible values of p?\n4. Can p and q have opposite signs (one positive, one negative)? If so, how does this impact the possible values of p?\n5. Can p and q be zero? If so, how does this impact the possible values of p?\n6. How can we rewrite the equation pq - 4p - 2q = 2 to isolate p on one side?\n7. Can we use factoring to solve this equation? If so, how would we proceed?\n8. If factoring is not suitable, what other methods could we use to solve this equation?\n9. How can we determine the values of q that satisfy the equation for a given p?\n10. What is the relationship between p and q that allows the equation to be satisfied?\n11. Can we find any specific values of p that satisfy the equation? If so, how would we find them?\n12. How many values of p between 1 and 10 inclusive satisfy the given equation?"
