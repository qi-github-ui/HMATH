    "problem": "The graph of the equation $y = |x| - 3$ is translated two units to the left and three units down. What are the coordinates of the minimum point of the new graph?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $|x|$ is nonnegative, it is minimized when it equals 0, which occurs when $x=0$.  So, the minimum point of the graph of $y=|x| - 3$ is $(0,-3)$.  When we translate this to the left two units and three units down, we get the point $\\boxed{(-2,-6)}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the steps involved in translating a graph two units to the left and three units down?\n2. How does translating a graph affect the original coordinates of its points?\n3. What specific equation represents the translated graph based on the given information?\n4. How can you find the coordinates of the minimum point of a graph?\n5. What is the significance of the minimum point in relation to the graph's behavior?\n6. Can you think of any other graphs or equations where finding the minimum or maximum point is important?"
