    "problem": "If $f(1)=5$, $f(2)=8$ and $f(x)=ax+bx+2$, what is the value of $f(3)$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "By the definition of $f(x)$, we have $f(3) = 3a+3b + 2$, so if we find $3a+3b$, we can find $f(3)$. Since $f(1) = a+b+2$ (by the definition of $f(x)$) and $f(1) = 5$, we have $a+b+2 = 5$, so $a+b = 3$.  Multiplying this by 3 gives $3a+3b = 9$, so $f(3) = 3a+3b + 2 = 9+2 = \\boxed{11}$.   Notice that we didn't even need the information about $f(2)$!",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the general form of the function f(x)?\n2. How can we use the given information about f(1) and f(2) to find the values of a and b?\n3. If we substitute x=3 into the function f(x), what would be the expression for f(3)?\n4. How can we simplify the expression for f(3) using the values of a, b, and the given expression for f(x)?\n5. If we substitute the calculated values of a, b, and x=3 into the simplified expression for f(3), what would be the numerical value?\n6. Can we generalize this method to find the value of f(n) for any given n?"
