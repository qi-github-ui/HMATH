    "problem": "Find all solutions to the equation $\\displaystyle\\sqrt[3]{2 - \\frac{x}{2}} = -3$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We get rid of the cube root sign by cubing both sides.  This gives us $2-\\frac{x}{2} = -27$.  Solving this equation gives $x =\\boxed{58}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the first step in solving this equation? What operation would you apply to both sides?\n2. How would you isolate the variable so that you can solve for it? What steps would you take?\n3. What is the meaning of the cube root symbol (\u221b) in this equation? How does it affect the solution process?\n4. Can you explain why the equation simplifies to $\\displaystyle 2 - \\frac{x}{2} = (-3)^{3}$? What property or rule are we using here?\n5. How would you solve for $x$ in the equation $\\displaystyle 2-\\frac{x}{2}= -27$ once you have simplified it using the previous step?\n6. Are there any restrictions on the value of $x$ in this equation? Are there any values of $x$ for which the equation would not be true?\n7.
