    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x= \\log_{\\sqrt{6}}(216\\sqrt{6})$.  Putting this in exponential notation gives $(\\sqrt{6})^x = 216\\sqrt{6}$.  Writing both sides with $6$ as the base gives us $6^{\\frac{x}{2}} = 6^3\\cdot 6^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 6^{\\frac{7}{2}}$, so $x/2=7/2$.  Therefore, $x=\\boxed{7}$.",
