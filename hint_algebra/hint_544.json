    "problem": "In solving the system of equations $y = 7$ and $x^2+ y^2= 100,$ what is the sum of the solutions for $x?$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$y = 7$ represents a horizontal line that intersects a circle of radius $10$ around the origin. The symmetry of the circle guarantees that the points of intersection have a sum which add up to $0.$\n\nAlternatively, we can simply substitute $7$ into the second equation for $y,$ to get that $x^2 = 51.$ Then, the two possible values for $x$ are $\\sqrt{51},-\\sqrt{51}.$ It's clear that they add up to $\\boxed{0}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this system of equations?\n2. What methods do you know for solving systems of equations? Which method would you choose in this case?\n3. If you choose the substitution method, how would you substitute the value of y into the second equation? \n4. Why does substituting the value of y into the second equation lead to a quadratic equation in terms of x? What is the significance of this quadratic equation? \n5. How would you solve the quadratic equation to find the possible values of x? Are any of these values extraneous solutions? \n6. Can you think of any other types of equations where a similar approach could be used to solve them?"
