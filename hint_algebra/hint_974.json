    "problem": "The Cookie Monster encounters a cookie whose boundary is the equation $x^2+y^2 + 21 = 4x + 18 y$ and is very confused. He wants to know if this cookie is a lunch-sized cookie or a snack-sized cookie. What is the radius of this cookie?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The equation $x^2+y^2+21=4x+18y$ can be rewritten as $x^2-4x+y^2-18y=-21$. Completing the square, this can further be rewritten as $(x-2)^2-4+(y-9)^2-81=-21$. Moving the constants to the right side of the equation, this is $(x-2)^2+(y-9)^2=64$, which is the equation of a circle with center $(2,9)$ and radius $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the equation and its components in this problem?\n2. How would you start in determining the type and size of the cookie based on the equation?\n3. What does it mean for a circle to have a particular equation in terms of x and y?\n4. What steps can you take to transform the given equation into the standard form of a circle equation?\n5. How can you identify the center and radius of the circle based on its equation?\n6. Are there any special techniques or theorems you can use to simplify the equation and determine the radius?\n7. Can you apply the completing the square method to convert the equation to the standard form, and what insights can you gain from doing so?\n8. How can you compare the given equation to the standard form of a circle equation to determine the center and radius?\n9. Can you identify the values of h and k in the equation and explain their significance in terms of the center of the circle?\n10. Once you have the equation in standard form, how can you determine the radius and its relationship to the coefficients of x and y?\n11. How would you calculate the radius based on the given equation? What other information might you need?\n12. Can you now determine if the cookie is lunch-sized or snack-sized based on the derived radius?"
