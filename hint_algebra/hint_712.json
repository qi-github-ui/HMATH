    "problem": "What is the $y$-coordinate of the point on the $y$-axis that is equidistant from points $A( -2, 0)$ and $B(-1,4)$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Because the point for which we are looking is on the $y$-axis, we know that it is of the form $(0,y)$. We apply the distance formula. The distance from A is  \\[\\sqrt{(-2-0)^2+(0-y)^2} = \\sqrt{y^2+4}\\]The distance from B is  \\[\\sqrt{(-1-0)^2 + (4-y)^2} = \\sqrt{y^2-8y+17}\\]Because the point is equidistant from $A$ and $B$, we set the two distances equal: $y^2-8y+17 = y^2 + 4$. Simplifying gives us $8y=13$, or $y = \\boxed{\\frac{13}{8}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean for a point to be equidistant from two other points?\n2. How can we determine the distance between two points on a coordinate plane?\n3. Can you find the equation of the line containing the two given points, $A$ and $B$?\n4. How can we find the $y$-coordinate of a point on the $y$-axis?\n5. What is the formula for the distance between a point and a line?\n6. How can we use this formula to find the $y$-coordinate of the point we're looking for?\n7. Can you think of any other scenarios where finding the distance between points is useful in solving a problem?\n8. How would the method of finding the equidistant point change if the given points were in a different quadrant or on different axes?"
