    "problem": "A ball bounces back up $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the height from which it falls. If the ball is dropped from a height of $243$ cm, after how many bounces does the ball first rise less than $30$ cm?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If you call the number of bounces $b$, then this problem can be phrased as: what is the minimum $b$, such that $243\\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^b < 30 \\rightarrow \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^b < \\frac{30}{243}$, at which point you can take the logarithm of both sides and solve for it exactly, but given that you can use your calculator, it's much easier to just multiply $\\frac{2}{3}$ with itself repeatedly until the product is less than $\\frac{30}{243}$.  Regardless of how you do it, you will get $b = \\boxed{6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. How can we represent the bounces mathematically?\n3. What is the formula or equation that represents the height of the ball after each bounce?\n4. How can we determine the height after multiple bounces?\n5. What is the number of bounces required for the ball to rise less than 30 cm?\n6. How can we verify that our solution is correct?\n7. Can you think of any real-life scenarios where a similar problem-solving approach might be useful?"
