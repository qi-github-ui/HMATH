    "problem": "Mark borrows $10$ dollars from Emily with a simple interest rate of $15\\%$ everyday. What is the least integer number of days after which Mark will have to pay her back at least twice as much as he borrowed?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the interest rate is simple, he has to pay an interest of $10 \\cdot 0.15 =1.5$ dollars every day.\n\nLet $x$ be the number of days needed to repay at least double the amount borrowed. Since he has to repay $10 as well as $\\$1.5x$ in interest, we have the inequality $10+1.5x \\ge 10 \\cdot 2$. Solving for $x$, we get $x \\ge 6.\\overline{6}$. The smallest integer greater than $6.\\overline{6}$ is $7$. Therefore, it would take at least $\\boxed{7 \\text{ days}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the concept of simple interest in this scenario and how it relates to borrowing money?\n2. What formula can we use to calculate the amount of interest Mark will have to pay after a certain number of days?\n3. How can we express the total amount Mark will have to pay back after a given number of days, taking both the borrowed amount and the interest into account?\n4. What is the least integer number of days that Mark will have to wait in order to pay Emily back at least twice as much as he borrowed?\n5. How do we determine if the amount Mark has to pay after a certain number of days is at least twice as much as the amount he borrowed?\n6. Can you think of any other scenarios or situations where the concept of simple interest would be applicable?"
