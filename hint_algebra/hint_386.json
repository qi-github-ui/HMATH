    "problem": "There are two ${\\bf positive}$ integers $c$ for which the equation $$5x^2+11x+c=0$$has rational solutions. What is the product of those two values of $c$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "By the quadratic formula, the equation $5x^2+11x+c=0$ has solutions $$x = \\frac{-(11)\\pm\\sqrt{(11)^2-4(5)(c)}}{2(5)} = \\frac{-11\\pm\\sqrt{121-20c}}{10}.$$For these solutions to be rational, the quantity under the square root (i.e., the discriminant) must be a perfect square. So, we seek the possible (positive integer) values of $c$ for which $121-20c$ is a square. The possible nonnegative values for $121-20c$ are $101$, $81$, $61$, $41$, $21$, or $1$. The only squares in this list are $81$, coming from $c=2$, and $1$, coming from $c=6$. So the product of the two possible $c$ values is $2\\cdot 6=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for an equation to have rational solutions?\n2. Given the equation $5x^2+11x+c=0$, what conditions must be true for the equation to have rational solutions?\n3. Are there any restrictions on the values of $c$ that would allow the equation to have rational solutions? If so, what are they?\n4. How can we determine the product of the values of $c$ that satisfy the equation having rational solutions?\n5. Are there any other approaches or methods you can think of to solve this problem?\n6. Can you think of any similar equations that might require a similar approach or reasoning to find the product of their solutions?"
