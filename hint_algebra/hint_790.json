    "problem": "If $y = -x^2 + 5$ and $x$ is a real number, then what is the maximum value possible for $y$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the square of any real number is nonnegative, the greatest possible value of $-x^2$ is 0, which is achieved when $x=0$.  Therefore, the greatest possible value of $y = -x^2 + 5$ is $\\boxed{5}$, which is achieved when $x=0$.",
