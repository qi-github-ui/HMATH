    "problem": "What is the sum of all values of $y$ for which the expression $\\frac{y+6}{y^2-5y+4}$ is undefined?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The given expression is undefined when the denominator is zero. Thus, we want to find the sum of the zeros $y$ to the quadratic $y^2-5y+4$. Since for a quadratic with the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the solutions is $-b/a$, the sum of the zeros of the quadratic $y^2-5y+4$ is $5/1=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for an expression to be undefined?\n2. What conditions would make the expression $\\frac{y+6}{y^2-5y+4}$ undefined?\n3. Can you determine the values of $y$ that would make the denominator of the expression equal to zero?\n4. How could you find the values of $y$ that make the denominator zero?\n5. What would be the sum of all the values of $y$ that satisfy the condition from the previous question?\n6. Are there any other types of expressions or equations where finding the values that make them undefined would be important?"
