    "solution": "Solution 1. Note that \\[\\begin{aligned}  \\left(x+\\frac{1}{y} \\right) \\left(y+\\frac{1}{z} \\right) \\left(z+\\frac{1}{x} \\right) &= xyz + x+y+z + \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} + \\frac{1}{xyz} \\\\&= xyz + \\left(x+\\frac{1}{y} \\right) + \\left(y+\\frac{1}{z} \\right) + \\left(z+\\frac{1}{x} \\right) + \\frac{1}{xyz}.\\end{aligned}\\]Plugging in the given values, we have \\[4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{7}{3} = xyz + 4 + 1 + \\frac{7}{3} + \\frac{1}{xyz}\\]or \\[\\frac{28}{3} = xyz + \\frac{22}{3} + \\frac{1}{xyz}.\\]Thus, $xyz + \\frac{1}{xyz} = 2$. Multiplying by $xyz$ and rearranging, we get $(xyz-1)^2 = 0$, so $xyz=\\boxed{1}$.\n\nSolution 2. Repeatedly substitute, in order to create an equation in a single variable. The second equation gives $y = 1- \\frac{1}{z}$, and the third equation gives $z = \\frac{7}{3} - \\frac{1}{x}$, so \\[4 =x + \\frac{1}{y} = x + \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{z}} = x + \\frac{z}{z - 1} = x + \\frac{\\frac{7}{3} - \\frac{1}{x}}{\\frac{4}{3} - \\frac{1}{x}}.\\]Simplifying and multiplying to clear denominators, we get the quadratic $(2x-3)^2 = 0$. Thus, $x = \\frac{3}{2}$, so $z = \\frac{7}{3} - \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{5}{3}$ and $y = 1- \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{2}{5}$. Therefore, the answer is \\[xyz = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{3} = \\boxed{1}.\\]",
