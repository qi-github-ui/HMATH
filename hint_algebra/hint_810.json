    "problem": "If the system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2x-y&=a,\\\\\n3y-6x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has a solution, find $\\frac{a}{b},$ assuming $b \\neq 0.$",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If we multiply the first equation by $-3$, we obtain\n\n$$3y-6x=-3a.$$Since we also know that $3y-6x=b$, we have\n\n$$-3a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{3}}.$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you identify the number of variables in the given system of equations? What are they?\n2. How many equations are there in the system? What is the significance of having an equal number of equations and variables?\n3. Are the given equations linear or nonlinear? How can you determine this?\n4. If the system has a solution, what does it imply about the lines represented by the equations? \n5. Can you classify the system as consistent, inconsistent, or dependent? How does this affect the solution?\n6. If the system has a solution, can you express it as an ordered pair? What would be the meaning of this ordered pair within the context of the problem?\n7. Can you write the system of equations in matrix form and solve it using matrix operations? How does this approach relate to finding the solution?\n8. Assuming the given system has a solution, can you manipulate the equations to find the values of $a$ and $b$? \n9. How would you proceed to eliminate one variable and solve for the remaining variable in terms of $a$ and $b$?\n10. Once you have solved for one variable, how can you determine the value of the other variable?\n11. How can you express $\\frac{a}{b}$ in terms of the values obtained for the variables?"
