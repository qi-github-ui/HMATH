    "problem": "On the Cartesian plane, the midpoint between two points $A(a,b)$ and $B(c,d)$ is $M(m,n)$. If $A$ is moved vertically upwards 8 units and horizontally to the right 2 units, and $B$ is moved vertically downwards 2 units and horizontally to the left 10 units, then the new midpoint between $A$ and $B$ is $M'$. What is the distance between $M$ and $M'$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Before moving, the midpoint (in terms of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$) is $M(m,n)=\\left(\\frac{a+c}{2},\\frac{b+d}{2}\\right)$. $A$ is moved to a point $(a+2,b+8)$. $B$ is moved to a point $(c-10,d-2)$. We find that the new midpoint $M'$ is \\begin{align*}\n\\left(\\frac{a+2+c-10}{2},\\frac{b+8+d-2}{2}\\right)&=\\left(\\frac{a+c}{2}-4,\\frac{b+d}{2}+3\\right)\\\\\n&=(m-4,n+3).\n\\end{align*}Thus, the distance between $M$ and $M'$ is equivalent to the distance between $(m,n)$ and $(m-4,n+3)$, or $$\\sqrt{(m-4-m)^2+(n+3-n)^2}=\\boxed{5}.$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How do we define the midpoint between two points on the Cartesian plane?\n2. Can you express the coordinates of point M in terms of the coordinates of points A and B?\n3. What happens to the x-coordinate of point A if it is moved horizontally to the right by 2 units?\n4. And what happens to the y-coordinate of point A if it is moved vertically upwards by 8 units?\n5. Similarly, how do the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of point B change if it is moved horizontally to the left by 10 units and vertically downwards by 2 units?\n6. Can you calculate the new coordinates of point M' after the translations of points A and B?\n7. How can we find the distance between points M and M' on the Cartesian plane?\n8. What formula or theorem can we apply to find the distance between two points on a Cartesian plane?"
