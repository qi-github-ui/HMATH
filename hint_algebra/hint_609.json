    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain how the function $E(a,b,c)$ works? What does each variable represent?\n2. How can we use the function to solve the equation $E(r,r,3) = 625$? What steps would you take?\n3. Are there any other ways to approach this equation? Can you think of alternative methods?\n4. Why do you think raising $r$ to the power of 3 is important in solving this equation?\n5. What values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ would make the equation $E(a,b,c) = 625$ true?\n6. How would you interpret the solution to this equation in the context of the function $E(a,b,c)$?"
