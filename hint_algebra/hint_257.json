    "solution": "One can find this by multiplying the two polynomials and computing the coefficients. Alternatively, we notice that the desired expression is simply the value of $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ evaluated at the point $x=2$: $a(2)^3 + b(2)^2 + c(2) + d = 8a + 4b + 2c + d$. Since $(3x^2 - 5x + 4)(7 - 2x)$ and  $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ are equivalent expressions, they are equal for all real values of $x$.  In particular, they are equal when $x=2$. So $8a+4b+2c+d=(3 \\cdot (2)^2 - 5 \\cdot (2) + 4)(7 - 2 \\cdot (2)) = 6 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{18}.$",
