    "problem": "If $g(x) = 3x + 7$ and $f(x) = 5x - 9$, what is the value of $f(g(8))$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$g(8)=3(8)+7=24+7=31$. Thus, $f(g(8))=f(31)=5(31)-9=155-9=\\boxed{146}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what $f(g(8))$ means in terms of function composition?\n2. What is the value of $g(8)$? How did you arrive at this value?\n3. Now that we have the value of $g(8)$, what is the value of $f(g(8))$? How can you calculate it?\n4. Can you substitute the value of $g(8)$ into the expression for $f(x)$? What does it look like after substitution?\n5. How would you simplify the expression $f(g(8))$ to find the final value?\n6. Is there any other way to approach this problem? Can you think of another method or strategy to find the value of $f(g(8))$?"
