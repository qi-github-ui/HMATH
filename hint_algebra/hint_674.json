    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Recall that if a function $f$ satisfies $f(x)=f(-x)$ for all real numbers $x$, then it is called an even function.  Similarly, if $f(x)=-f(-x)$ for all real numbers $x$, then $f$ is called an odd function.  Let's define $g(x)=x^4+x^2$ and $h(x)=5x$.  Observe that $g(x)$ is even, $h(x)$ is odd, and $f(x)=g(x)+h(x)$.  We have  \\begin{align*}\nf(5)-f(-5)&=g(5)+h(5)-g(-5)-h(-5) \\\\\n&= (g(5)-g(-5)) + h(5)-h(-5) \\\\\n&= 0 + 2h(5) \\\\\n&= 2(5(5)) \\\\\n&=\\boxed{50}.\n\\end{align*}",

What does $f(5)$ mean, and how would you calculate it?\n4. Similarly, what does $f(-5)$ mean, and how would you calculate it?\n5. Given the values of $f(5)$ and $f(-5)$, what operation do you need to perform to find $f(5) - f(-5)$? \n6. Can you simplify the expression $f(5) - f(-5)$?\n7. If we encounter a similar expression in the future, what steps can we take to calculate its value using function notation? \n8. Are there any other functions that can be used to evaluate expressions similar to $f(5) - f(-5)$?"
