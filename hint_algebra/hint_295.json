    "problem": "Find $t$ such that $(t,5)$ lies on the line through $(0,3)$ and $(-8,0)$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The slope of the line through $(0,3)$ and $(-8,0)$ is $(0-3)/(-8-0) = 3/8$. If $(t,5)$ is also on this line, then the slope of  the line through $(t,5)$ and $(0,3)$ must also be $3/8$.  Therefore, we must have \\[\\frac{3-5}{0-t} = \\frac{3}{8} \\implies \\frac{2}{t} = \\frac{3}{8} \\implies (2)(8) = 3(t) \\implies t = \\boxed{\\frac{16}{3}}.\\]",
