    "problem": "Simplify $\\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i}$. Your answer should be of the form $a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are both real numbers and written as improper fractions (if necessary).",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we have \\begin{align*}\n\\dfrac{3+4i}{1+2i} \\cdot \\frac{1-2i}{1-2i} &= \\frac{3(1) + 3(-2i) + 4i(1) + 4i(-2i)}{1(1) + 1(-2i) + 2i(1) -2i(2i)} \\\\\n&= \\dfrac{11-2i}{5} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{5} - \\dfrac{2}{5}i}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in simplifying the given expression?\n2. Are you familiar with any properties or rules that can be applied to simplify complex numbers?\n3. If you were to start by multiplying both the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the conjugate of the denominator, what values would you get?\n4. Why is multiplying by the conjugate of the denominator helpful in this case? What does it allow us to simplify or eliminate?\n5. After multiplying the numerator and denominator, what are the resulting expressions? Can you simplify further?\n6. Can you express the final answer in the form $a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, potentially written as improper fractions?"
