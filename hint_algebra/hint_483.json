    "solution": "Multiplying the whole equation by $6x$ will get rid of the fractions: \\begin{align*}\n5x^2+6x&=18 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\\\\n5x^2+6x-18&=0.\n\\end{align*}Since the expression on the left-hand side does not factor easily, we use the quadratic formula to get \\begin{align*}\nx&=\\frac{-6\\pm\\sqrt{36+360}}{10}\\\\\n&=\\frac{-6\\pm\\sqrt{396}}{10}\\\\\n&=\\frac{-6\\pm6\\sqrt{11}}{10}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the largest possible value for $x$ is $\\frac{-6+6\\sqrt{11}}{10}$, or $\\frac{-3+3\\sqrt{11}}{5}$. Applying this to $\\frac{a+b\\sqrt{c}}{d}$, $a=-3$, $b=3$, $c=11$, and $d=5$. \\[\\frac{acd}{b}=\\frac{-3\\cdot11\\cdot5}{3}=\\boxed{-55}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Before we begin, can you describe what the given equation is asking us to find?\n2. What would be the first step in simplifying the equation $\\frac{5x}{6} + 1 = \\frac{3}{x}$?\n3. Are there any specific methods or strategies that come to mind for solving this type of equation? If so, what are they?\n4. If we decide to multiply both sides of the equation by $6x$, what does that accomplish? Why is this step useful?\n5. After multiplying both sides by $6x$, what does the equation simplify to? How can we further simplify it?\n6. Looking at the newly simplified equation, can you identify any patterns or relationships that might help us find the largest possible value of $x$?\n7. How can we rewrite the equation in the form $x = \\frac{a + b \\sqrt{c}}{d}$?\n8. What are the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ in this case?\n9. Based on the simplified equation, what do you think is the largest possible value of $x$ in the form $\\frac{a + b \\sqrt{c}}{d}$?\n10. Finally, what is $\\frac{acd}{b}$? How did you arrive at this result?"
