    "problem": "The 2007 AMC 10 will be scored by awarding $6$ points for each correct response, $0$ points for each incorrect response, and $1.5$ points for each problem left unanswered. After looking over the $25$ problems, Sarah has decided to attempt the first $22$ and leave only the last $3$ unanswered.\n\nHow many of the first $22$ problems must she solve correctly in order to score at least $100$ points?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Sarah will receive $4.5$ points for the three questions she leaves unanswered, so she must earn at least $100-4.5=95.5$ points on the first $22$ problems. Because \\[\n15 < \\frac{95.5}{6} < 16,\n\\]she must solve at least $\\boxed{16}$ of the first $22$ problems correctly. This would give her a score of $100.5.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of points Sarah can score on the first 22 problems?\n2. How many points does Sarah get for each correct response?\n3. How many points does Sarah lose for each incorrect response?\n4. How many points does Sarah get for each problem left unanswered?\n5. How many points does Sarah earn for getting all 22 problems correct?\n6. How many points does Sarah lose for getting all 22 problems incorrect?\n7. How many points does Sarah earn for leaving the last 3 problems unanswered?\n8. How many points would Sarah score if she solved x out of the first 22 problems correctly?\n9. What is the equation that represents the total score Sarah will get for solving x problems correctly out of the first 22?\n10. How many problems does Sarah need to solve correctly in order to score at least 100 points?\n11. How can we write an inequality using the equation from question 9 to represent Sarah's goal of scoring at least 100 points?\n12. What is the solution to the inequality from question 11?"
