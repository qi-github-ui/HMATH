    "problem": "Find the $y$-intercept point of the line $3x+5y=20$.  Provide your answer as an ordered pair.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can find the slope and the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept quickly by putting the equation in slope-intercept form.  Solving the equation $3x+5y=20$ for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives $y = -\\frac{3}{5}x +4$.  So, the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{(0,4)}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you define what the y-intercept represents in the context of a linear equation?\n2. What do you understand by the term \"y-intercept point\"?\n3. How would you determine the y-intercept of a given equation?\n4. What steps would you take to find the y-intercept point of the equation 3x+5y=20?\n5. Could you explain the reasoning behind the steps you mentioned in the previous question?\n6. If you substitute the x-value with zero in the equation, what would be the value of y? How does this relate to the y-intercept point?\n7. Could you write down the equation in slope-intercept form, and explain how it relates to the y-intercept? \n8. How does recognizing the slope and y-intercept help in determining the location of the y-intercept point?\n9. Can you provide the ordered pair that represents the y-intercept of the line 3x+5y=20?"
