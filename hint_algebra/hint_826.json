    "problem": "On the Cartesian plane in which each unit is one foot, a dog is tied to a post on the point $(4,3)$ by a $10$ foot rope. What is the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The area the dog can go in is a circle of radius $10$ centered at the point $(4,3)$. The point farthest from $(0,0)$ in the circle would be the point on the circle's circumference which is on the same diameter as $(0,0)$ but on the other side of the center of the circle.\nThe distance from the origin to the center of the circle, by the distance formula, is $\\sqrt{(4-0)^2+(3-0)^2}=\\sqrt{16+9}=5$. As the radius of the circle is $10$, the distance from the origin to the point in the circle farthest from the origin is $\\boxed{15}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the Cartesian plane is and how it is used to represent points?\n2. What does it mean for the dog to be tied to a post at the point (4,3) on the Cartesian plane?\n3. How can we visualize the dog being tied to the post using a rope with a length of 10 feet?\n4. What does it mean for the dog to be at the greatest distance from the origin?\n5. Can you think of a geometric shape that could represent all the possible locations the dog can be when tied with a 10-foot rope at point (4,3)? \n6. How can you find the distance from the origin to any point on this geometric shape?\n7. How do you determine which point on the geometric shape represents the maximum distance from the origin?\n8. Can you calculate the coordinates of the point on the geometric shape that represents the greatest distance from the origin in this scenario?\n9. How would the answer change if the length of the rope were different? Can you describe any patterns or relationships you observe?"
