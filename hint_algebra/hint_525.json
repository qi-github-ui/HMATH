    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Clearly, the inequality has some solutions for which $2x+7$ is negative.  For example, if $x = -4$, then $2x+7 = -1$, so $|2x+7| = 1$, which is less than 16.  As we make $x$ even smaller, $2x+7$ gets even more less than zero, so $|2x+7|$ gets larger.  But how small can we make $x$?  To figure this out, we note that if $2x+7$ is negative, then $|2x+7| = -(2x+7)$.  Then, our inequality becomes $-(2x+7) \\le 16$.  Multiplying both sides by $-1$ (and flipping the direction of the inequality symbol) gives $2x +7 \\ge -16$.  Subtracting 7 and then dividing by 2 gives $x \\ge -11.5$.  So, the smallest possible integer value for $x$ is $\\boxed{-11}$.  Checking, we see that when $x=-11$, we have $|2x + 7| = 15$, which is less than 16.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you interpret the inequality $\\lvert2x+ 7\\rvert\\le 16$ in words?\n2. Can you explain the concept of absolute value and how it relates to this inequality?\n3. How would you approach solving this inequality? What steps would you take?\n4. Can you think of any different methods or approaches to solve inequalities like this one?\n5. If you choose to isolate the absolute value term and split the inequality into two cases, what are the two cases and why do we need to consider them separately?\n6. What values of $x$ satisfy each of the two cases you've identified? How would you express these two solution sets using interval notation?\n7. Can you determine the smallest integer value of $x$ that satisfies the original inequality? How did you arrive at that value?\n8. How could you verify that your solution is correct? Is there a way to check it algebraically?\n9. Are there any general principles or strategies you can apply when solving absolute value inequalities like this one?\n10. Can you think of any other examples or scenarios where understanding absolute value and solving inequalities could be useful?"
