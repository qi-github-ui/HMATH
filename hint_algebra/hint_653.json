    "problem": "If the three lines $3y-2x=1$, $x+2y=2$ and $4x-6y=5$ are drawn in the plane, how many points will lie at the intersection of at least two of the three lines?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "In general, two lines intersect in exactly one point, unless they are parallel, in which case they are either the same line or have no intersection points.  First, check to see if any of these lines are parallel.  The first line $3y-2x=1$ has a slope of $2/3$,  the second line has a slope of $-1/2$, and the third line has a slope of $4/6=2/3$.  So, the first and third lines are parallel.  We can easily check that these are not the same line.  Therefore, these two lines do not intersect anywhere, and the third line intersects each of them in exactly one point, for a total of $\\boxed{2}$ intersection points.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the standard form of each of the given lines?\n2. Can you identify the slope and y-intercept of each line?\n3. Are any of the given lines parallel to each other? How can you determine this?\n4. How can we find the points of intersection between two lines algebraically?\n5. Are there any lines among the three that are parallel? If so, how does that affect the number of intersection points?\n6. Is it possible for all three lines to intersect at exactly one point? Why or why not?\n7. How can we determine if two lines are identical or coincident?\n8. Can you write the equations of the lines in slope-intercept form and compare the slopes to consider their intersection behavior?\n9. How does the number of intersection points relate to the solution of the given system of equations?\n10. Can you generalize this concept to a system of equations with more than three variables and equations?"
