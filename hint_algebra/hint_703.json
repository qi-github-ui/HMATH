    "problem": "We define a function $f(x)$ such that $f(11)=34$, and if there exists an integer $a$ such that $f(a)=b$, then $f(b)$ is defined and\n\n$f(b)=3b+1$ if $b$ is odd\n\n$f(b)=\\frac{b}{2}$ if $b$ is even.\n\nWhat is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $f(11)=34$, we know that $f(34)$ is defined, and it must equal $17$.  Similarly, we know that $f(17)$ is defined, and it must equal $52$.  Continuing on this way,\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(52)&=26\\\\\nf(26)&=13\\\\\nf(13)&=40\\\\\nf(40)&=20\\\\\nf(20)&=10\\\\\nf(10)&=5\\\\\nf(5)&=16\\\\\nf(16)&=8\\\\\nf(8)&=4\\\\\nf(4)&=2\\\\\nf(2)&=1\\\\\nf(1)&=4\n\\end{align*}We are now in a cycle $1$, $4$, $2$, $1$, and so on.  Thus there are no more values which need to be defined, as there is no $a$ currently defined for which $f(a)$ is a $b$ not already defined.  Thus the minimum number of integers we can define is the number we have already defined, which is $\\boxed{15}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the given definition of the function $f(x)$ in your own words? \n2. How can we use the given definition to find the value of $f(11)$? \n3. Based on the definition of $f(x)$, what can we say about the domain of the function? \n4. Is there a pattern or rule that we can observe in how $f(x)$ operates based on its definition? \n5. According to the definition of $f(x)$, what would be the value of $f(34)$? \n6. Can you find the value of $f(34)$ by applying the given rules for odd and even numbers? \n7. How can we determine the domain of $f$ in order to find the smallest number of integers? \n8. What is the smallest possible number of integers in the domain of $f$?"
