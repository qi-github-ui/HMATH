    "problem": "What is the greatest product obtainable from two integers whose sum is 1998?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the two integers be $x$ and $1998-x$. The product which needs to be maximized is $1998x-x^2$. Completing the square results in $-(x-999)^2+999^2$. Since $-(x-999)^2\\le 0$, the expression is maximized when $x=999$, which results in a value of $999^2=\\boxed{998001}$.",
