    "problem": "Consider two positive even integers less than $15$ (not necessarily distinct). When the sum of these two numbers is added to their product, how many different possible values may result?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $p$ and $q$ be the two integers; then $p,q \\in \\{2,4,6,8,10,12,14\\}$, giving $7 \\times 7 = 49$ total possible pairs $(p,q)$. The question asks for the number of different values of $pq + p + q$. Notice that by Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, $$pq + p + q = (p+1)(q+1) - 1,$$so it suffices to find the number of different possible values of $(p+1)(q+1)$. Here, $p+1,q+1 \\in \\{3,5,7,9,11,13,15\\}$.\n\nThere are $7$ pairs $(p,q)$ where $p+1$ is equal to $q+1$; by symmetry, half of the $42$ remaining pairs correspond to swapping the values of $p$ and $q$, leaving $42/2 = 21$ pairs $(p,q)$. Since most of the possible values of $p+1$ and $q+1$ are prime factors that do not divide into any of the other numbers, we note that most of the values of $(p+1)(q+1)$ will be distinct. The exception are the numbers divisible by $3$ and $5$: $p+1,q+1 \\in \\{3,5,9,15\\}$; then, if $(p+1,q+1) = (3,15)$ or $(5,9)$, then $(p+1)(q+1) = 45$.\n\nHence, there are exactly $21-1+7 = \\boxed{27}$ distinct possible values of $pq + p + q$.",

How would you represent the two integers in terms of a variable?\n4. What is the relationship between the sum of the two numbers and their product?\n5. Can you express the sum of the two numbers algebraically? And the product?\n6. How many different values can the sum of the two numbers and their product take?\n7. Can you explain why there might be more than one possible value for the sum of the numbers and their product?\n8. Can you list all the possible values that may result from the sum of the two numbers and their product?\n9. Are there any patterns or observations you can make from the list of possible values?\n10. Can you think of any other scenarios or problems where a similar approach of finding the sum and product might be useful?"
