What does it mean to evaluate $f(3)$ algebraically?\n6. How can we determine which condition of the function applies for the input value $x = 3$?\n7. What is the value of $f(3)$ according to the first condition of the function?\n8. What is the value of $f(3)$ according to the second condition of the function?\n9. How do we decide which value of $f(3)$ is the correct one?\n10. Can you summarize the steps involved in finding the value of $f(3)$?"
