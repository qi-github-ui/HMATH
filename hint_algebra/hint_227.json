    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Substitute 1 for $x$ in the expression defining $f$ to find that $f(1)=3(1)^2-5=-2$.  Substituting $-2$ for $x$, we find $f(f(1))=f(-2)=3(-2)^2-5=\\boxed{7}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the function $f(x)$ represents?\n2. What happens when we substitute 1 into the function $f(x)$? What is $f(1)$ equal to?\n3. If we substitute $f(1)$ back into the function $f(x)$, what will the new expression become?\n4. Can you simplify the expression $f(f(1))$ by substituting the value of $f(1)$?\n5. What is the value of $f(f(1))$ after simplification?\n6. Can you think of any other functions where we can use similar steps to find the value of a composition like $f(f(1))$?"
