    "problem": "A line with slope 3 intersects a line with slope 5 at the point $(10,15)$. What is the distance between the $x$-intercepts of these two lines?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The two lines have equations \\[\ny -15=3(x-10)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad y -15=5(x-10).\n\\]The $x$-intercepts, obtained by setting $y=0$ in the respective equations, are 5 and 7.  The distance between the  points $(5,0)$ and $(7,0)$ is $\\boxed{2}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we determine the equations of the two lines if we know their slopes and the point of intersection?\n2. What does the slope of a line represent geometrically, and how does it relate to the line's equation?\n3. How can we calculate the equation of a line if we know its slope and a point on the line?\n4. How can we find the $x$-intercept of a line if we have its equation? \n5. Can we determine the $x$-intercepts of the lines in question just by knowing their slopes? If not, what additional information do we need?\n6. How can we find the distance between two points on a coordinate plane?\n7. Given the coordinates of a point and the slope of a line, how can we find the equation of that line?\n8. How can we find the $x$-intercept of a line if we have its equation? \n9. Once we have the equations of the two lines, how can we determine their $x$-intercepts?\n10. How can we calculate the distance between two $x$-intercepts on the coordinate plane once we know their coordinates?"
