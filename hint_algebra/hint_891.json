    "solution": "First, we use the distributive property to expand the first two factors:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n3(x+4)(x+5) &= (3\\cdot x + 3 \\cdot 4) (x+5)\\\\\n&=(3x+12)(x+5)\n\\end{align*}We use the distributive property again by adding the product of $3x+12$ and $x$ to the product of $3x+12$ and 5:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(3x+12)(x+5) &= (3x+12) \\cdot x +(3x+12) \\cdot 5\\\\\n&= x(3x+12) + 5(3x+12)\n\\end{align*}We use the distributive property again and combine like terms:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx(3x+12) + 5(3x+12) &= 3x^2 + 12x + 15x+ 60\\\\\n&= \\boxed{3x^2 + 27x + 60}\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step you would take to expand the product ${3(x+4)(x+5)}$?\n2. How would you distribute the 3 to each term inside the parentheses?\n3. What would be the result of distributing the 3 to the terms $(x+4)$ and $(x+5)$ individually?\n4. Can you simplify each distributed term by combining like terms?\n5. What would be the final expression after simplifying the distributed terms?\n6. Are there any similar types of products that you can think of where you would use similar steps to expand and simplify?"
