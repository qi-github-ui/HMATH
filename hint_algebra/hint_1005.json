    "problem": "Sam is hired for a 20-day period. On days that he works, he earns $\\$$60. For each day that he does not work, $\\$$30 is subtracted from his earnings. At the end of the 20-day period, he received $\\$$660. How many days did he not work?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\nx+y &= 20 \\\\\n60x - 30y &= 660 \\\\\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\\boxed{6}$ days.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the problem is asking us to find?\n2. What is the equation that represents Sam's earnings over the 20-day period?\n3. How can we express the number of days Sam worked and the number of days he did not work in terms of variables or unknowns?\n4. Can you write an equation that represents the total amount Sam earned over the 20-day period?\n5. How can we represent the earnings on the days Sam worked? \n6. And how can we represent the earnings on the days he did not work?\n7. Can you write an equation that represents Sam's total earnings?\n8. How can we solve this equation to determine the number of days Sam did not work?\n9. What are the possible values for the number of days Sam did not work?\n10.
