    "problem": "In a sequence of positive integers each term after the first is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the sum of the term that precedes it and the term that follows it in the sequence. What is the 5th term of this sequence if the 1st term is 2 and the 4th term is 34?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $a,b,c$ be 2nd, 3rd, and 5th terms respectively. Our sequence is therefore $2,a,b,34,c,\\dots$. From the information given, we have \\begin{align*}\na &= \\frac13(2+b)\\\\\nb &= \\frac13(a+34)\\\\\n34 &= \\frac13(b+c).\n\\end{align*} Before we find $c$, we use the first two equations to solve for $b$. Substituting $a = \\frac13(2+b)$, we obtain \\begin{align*}\nb &= \\frac13(\\frac13(2+b)+34)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 3b &= \\frac13(2+b)+34\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 9b &= 2+b+102\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 8b &= 104\\\\\n\\Rightarrow b &= 13.\n\\end{align*} Substituting $b = 13$ into $34 = \\frac13(b+c)$, we obtain \\begin{align*}\n34 &= \\frac13(13+c)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow 102 &= 13+c\\\\\n\\Rightarrow c &= \\boxed{89}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you describe the relationship between each term in the sequence?\n2. Can you explain why the first term is given as 2? How does this value affect the sequence?\n3. What do we know about the 4th term specifically, and how can we utilize that information to find the 5th term?\n4. How can we use the information about each term being $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the sum of the preceding and succeeding terms to find the missing term?\n5. Can you define a systematic approach to solve this sequence problem given the information provided?\n6. If the 5th term is found to be a certain value, how can we confirm that it satisfies the given conditions of the sequence?\n7. Are there any other patterns or sequences you can think of that follow a similar logic or structure?"
