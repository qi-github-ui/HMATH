    "problem": "How many integers satisfy the inequality $(x+3)^{2}\\leq1$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Distributing the left side of the inequality, we have $x^{2}+6x+9\\leq1$, which simplifies to $x^{2}+6x+8\\leq0$. This can be factored into $(x+2)(x+4)\\leq0$, and we can now look at the three regions formed by this inequality: $x<-4, -4\\leq x\\leq -2,$ and $x>-2$. We know that the signs in each of these regions alternate, and we test any number in each of the regions to make sure. Plugging into $(x+2)(x+4)$, any $x$ less than $-4$ yields a positive product, and any $x$ greater than $-2$ also yields a positive product. The remaining interval between $-2$ and $-4$ inclusive yields a nonpositive product. Thus, there are $\\boxed{3}$ integers which satisfy the inequality: $-2, -3$, and $-4$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the solution set of this inequality would look like on a number line?\n2. How would you approach solving this inequality algebraically?\n3. What does it mean for a squared quantity to be less than or equal to 1? How does that relate to the original inequality?\n4. What does the inequality $(x+3)^2 \\leq 1$ tell you about the distance between $x+3$ and 0? How does that help in finding the solution?\n5. Can you think of any scenarios where the squared expression would be equal to 1? How would that affect the number of solutions?\n6. Are there any other ways, besides algebraic methods, you can think of to solve this inequality?\n7. Can you generalize the steps you took to solve this inequality to similar problems involving squared expressions and inequalities?\n8. What would happen if the inequality sign were changed to \"greater than\" instead of \"less than or equal to\"? How would that affect the solution set?"
