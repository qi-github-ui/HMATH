    "problem": "If a rectangular prism has a length of $l$, a width of $w$, and a height of $h$, then the length of its diagonal is equal to $\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$. Suppose $l = 3$ and $h = 12$; if the length of the diagonal is $13$, what is the width?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We are given that $$\\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + w^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{153 + w^2} = 13.$$Squaring both sides, it follows that $$153 + w^2 = 13^2 = 169 \\quad\\Longrightarrow \\quad w = \\pm 4.$$Since the width must be a positive quantity, the answer is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the formula for finding the length of the diagonal of a rectangular prism?\n2. In this case, what are the given values for the length and height? Can we use them to find the width?\n3. How can we use the given values and the formula to set up an equation?\n4. What is the equation we can create using the formula and the given values?\n5. Now that we have the equation, how can we solve for the width?\n6. What steps can we take to isolate the variable and solve the equation?\n7. Apply the steps you discussed in question 6 to find the value of the width.\n8. Does the width you found make sense in the context of a rectangular prism?\n9. Can you think of any other scenarios where the length of the diagonal can be calculated similarly?"
