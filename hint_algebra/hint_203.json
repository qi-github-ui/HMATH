    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If we add $1$ to both sides of the equation, the left hand side may be factored using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick. Thus, $$xy + x + y + 1 = (x+1)(y+1) = 77.$$ Since $x,y$ are positive integers, then $x+1, y+1$ must be a pair of factors of $77$, which are given by $\\{x+1,y+1\\} = \\{1,77\\},\\{7,11\\}$. Thus, $\\{x,y\\} = \\{0,76\\},\\{6,10\\}$, though only the latter satisfies the given conditions. Hence, $x+y = 6 + 10 = \\boxed{16}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the given equation in your own words?\n2. What are the possible values for $x$ and $y$ since they are positive integers less than 20?\n3. Is there any specific strategy or technique you would use to solve this equation? If so, what is it?\n4. How would you try to simplify or manipulate the equation to make it easier to work with?\n5. What other information can you gather from the equation? Can you identify any patterns or relationships?\n6. Have you considered any trial and error method? If yes, how would you approach it?\n7. How does the equation relate the values of $x$, $y$, and $x+y$ to the constant 76?\n8. Can you think of any other equations that might require similar thinking or steps to solve?\n9. If $x+y=30$, will this contradict the given equation? Why or why not?\n10. What would be the most effective way to verify that your solution for $x+y$ is correct?"
