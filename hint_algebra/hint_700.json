    "problem": "Ramon sells two enchiladas and three tacos for $\\$$2.50 and he sells three enchiladas and two tacos for $\\$$2.70. Assuming a fixed price per item, what is the cost, in dollars, of three enchiladas and four tacos? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",

    "solution": "Suppose that a taco costs $t$ dollars and and enchiladas cost $e$ dollars each.  Then the given information implies that $2e + 3t = 2.50$ and $3e + 2t = 2.70$.  Multiplying the first equation by 3 yields $6e + 9t = 7.50$, and multiplying the second equation by 2 gives $6e + 4t = 5.40$.  Subtracting these two equations, we see that $5t = 2.10$.  Thus one taco costs $\\frac{2.10}{5} = .42$, and two tacos are $.84$.  Since we are given the price of three enchiladas and two tacos, we see that three enchiladas and four tacos total $2.70 + .84 = \\boxed{\\$3.54}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you summarize the given information about the cost of enchiladas and tacos?\n2. What unknowns do we need to find in this problem?\n3. Can we set up a system of equations to represent the given information? If so, what equations would be appropriate?\n4. How can we find the cost of one enchilada and one taco using the system of equations?\n5. Based on the cost we found in the previous question, how can we determine the cost of three enchiladas and two tacos?\n6. Now that we have the cost of three enchiladas and two tacos, how can we find the cost of three enchiladas and four tacos?\n7. Can you express the final answer in decimal form to the nearest hundredth?"
