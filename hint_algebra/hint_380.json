    "problem": "If $f(x)$ is a function defined only for $0 \\le x \\le 1$, and $f(x) = ax+b$ for constants $a$ and $b$ where $a < 0$, then what is the range of $f$ in terms of $a$ and $b$? Express your answer in interval notation.",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The function $f(x) = ax + b$ is linear, so as $x$ varies over the interval $0 \\le x \\le 1$, $f(x) = ax + b$ takes on all values between $b$ and $a + b$ (inclusive).  Furthermore, $a < 0$, so $a + b < b$.  Hence, the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{[a +b, b]}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean for a function to be defined only for $0 \\le x \\le 1$?\n2. What can we say about the form of $f(x)$ for this particular function?\n3. How does the value of $a$ affect the shape and direction of the graph of $f(x)$?\n4. What does it mean for $a$ to be less than 0 in this context?\n5. How does the value of $b$ affect the graph of $f(x)$?\n6. Can you explain why the range of $f$ would be different depending on the values of $a$ and $b$?\n7. What are the possible values of $f(x)$ for $0 \\le x \\le 1$ when $a$ is less than 0?\n8. How can we express the range of $f$ using interval notation?"
