Combining like terms, we get $3x^2-2x=0$. Factoring out a $x$, we have $x(3x-2)=0$. So either $x=0$ or $3x-2=0\\Rightarrow x=2/3$, which are the two $x$ coordinates of the points of intersection. Thus, $c=2/3$ and $a=0$, and $c-a=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

How can we determine the coordinates of the points of intersection between the parabolas defined by the equations $y=2x^2-4x+4$ and $y=-x^2-2x+4$?\n3. Are there any special techniques or methods that we can use to find the points of intersection between the given parabolas?\n4. How do we find the x-coordinates of the points of intersection between the two parabolas?\n5. Once we have the x-coordinates, how can we find the corresponding y-coordinates of the points of intersection?\n6. How can we determine which point of intersection has a larger x-coordinate, and which has a smaller x-coordinate?\n7. Given the coordinates of the points of intersection, how can we find the difference between the x-coordinates of those points?\n8. Can you find the specific values of $a$ and $c$ that correspond to the x-coordinates of the points of intersection?\n9. Once we have the values of $a$ and $c$, how can we calculate the difference $c-a$?\n10. Can you express the difference $c-a$ as a simplified fraction?"
