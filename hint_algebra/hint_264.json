    "solution": "Sum the first two equations to find $c+o+n=t.$ Solve the third equation for $c$ to find $c=s-t,$ and substitute $s-t$ for $c$ in $c+o+n=t$ to find $o+n+s-t=t\\implies o+n+s=2t.$ Substitute $12$ for $o+n+s$ to find $t=12/2=\\boxed{6}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does each variable in the equation represent?\n2. How can we proceed to find the value of the variable $t$ based on the given equations?\n3. Are there any equations that provide clues about the value of $t$ directly?\n4. If not, which equation(s) should we focus on to determine the value of $t$?\n5. Are there any restrictions or conditions on the values of the variables in the equation?\n6. Can we combine any of the given equations to eliminate some variables and simplify the problem?\n7. How can we utilize the equation $o + n + s = 12$ to find the value of $t$?\n8. Can we substitute known values into the equations to narrow down the possible values of $t$?\n9. Are there any logical deductions we can make based on the relationships between the variables in the equations?\n10. Is there only one possible value for $t$, or are there multiple solutions? How can we determine this?\n11. Can you think of any other strategies or approaches we can use to solve this type of problem?\n12. What other equations with similar patterns or relationships could we explore to further practice this concept?"
