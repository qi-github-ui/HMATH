    "problem": "What is the value of $x$ in the equation $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{2}{x} \\div \\frac{4}{x} = 0.75$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Turning the division sign into multiplication and simplifying, we have  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{2}{x}\\cdot\\frac{x}{4}&=.75 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{2}&=.75\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{x}&=.25\\\\\n\\Rightarrow x&=\\boxed{4}.\n\\end{align*}",
