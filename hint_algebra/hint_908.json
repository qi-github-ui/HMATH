    "solution": "Replace a triangle with the letter $a$ and a circle with the letter $b.$ The two given equations become \\begin{align*}\n3a+2b&=21\\\\\n2a+3b&=19.\n\\end{align*}Multiplying the first equation by $2,$ we get $6a+4b=42.$ Multiplying the second equation by $3,$ we get $6a+9b=57.$ Subtracting these two equations to eliminate $a,$ we have $5b=15.$ Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{3}{5},$ we get $$\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot 5b = \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot 15 \\Rightarrow 3b=9.$$Thus, three circles equals $\\boxed{9}.$",
