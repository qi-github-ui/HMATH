    "solution": "The number of squares in the rectangles is an arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 1. Thus, at Stage 6, there will be 6 squares. Since each square has an area of $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ square inches, the total area of the rectangle at Stage 6 is $6 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{54}$ square inches.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the dimensions of the rectangle at Stage 1?\n2. At each successive stage, what happens to the dimensions of the rectangle? \n3. How can we express the dimensions of the rectangle at each stage in terms of the stage number?\n4. In Stage 6, how many 3'' by 3'' squares would have been added? How does this affect the dimensions of the rectangle?\n5. What is the final area of the rectangle at Stage 6 in square inches? Can you calculate it?"
