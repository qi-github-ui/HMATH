    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the function $f(x)$ represents in this problem?\n2. When finding the sum of all values of $x$ such that $f(x) = 0$, what does it mean for the function $f(x)$ to equal zero?\n3. What should be the first step in solving this problem? How can you approach it?\n4. Are there any specific restrictions or conditions on the values of $x$ in this problem? If yes, what are they and how do they affect your solution?\n5. Can you identify the intervals on the number line where $f(x)$ is defined by different algebraic expressions? How would this help you determine the sum of the values of $x$ that satisfy $f(x) = 0$?\n6. What values of $x$ satisfy the equation $-x - 3 = 0$? How do you handle the other algebraic expression $\\frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0$?\n7. Can you rewrite the equation $\\frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0$ in a different form to make it easier to solve?\n8. After finding the solutions to $-x - 3 = 0$ and $\\frac{x}{2} + 1 = 0$, how can you combine them to find the sum of all values of $x$ that satisfy $f(x) = 0$?\n9. Is the solution to this problem unique, or are there alternative approaches or interpretations that could lead to a different answer?\n10. Can you think of any other algebraic functions or equations where a similar problem-solving approach can be applied?"
