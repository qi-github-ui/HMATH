    "solution": "We'll start with rods. The first row has 3 rods, the second row has 6 rods, and continuing down, we see that the next rows have 9, 12, 15, and so on rods. So the total number of rods in an eight-row triangle is $$\n3 + 6 + 9 + \\cdots + 24 = 3(1+2+3+\\cdots+8) = 3(36) = 108.\n$$For the connectors, note that in an $n$-row triangle, the connectors form a triangle which has $n+1$ rows. For example, a two-row triangle has three rows of connectors, and $1+2+3 = 6$ connectors. So an eight-row triangle has $1+2+3+\\cdots+9 = 45$ connectors. We have a total of $108+45 = \\boxed{153}$ pieces.",

Can you see a pattern in the number of pieces used as the number of rows increases? Can you explain this pattern?\n7. How many pieces would be used to create an eight-row triangle based on the pattern you observed?\n8. How does the number of connectors change as the number of rows increases?\n9. How does the number of unit rods change as the number of rows increases?\n10. Is there a formula or equation that can be used to calculate the total number of pieces in an n-row triangle? If so, what is it and how does it work?"
