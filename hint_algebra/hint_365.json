    "solution": "The pattern suggests that for a number with $n$ nines, that number squared has $n-1$ zeros. Thus, $99,\\!999,\\!999^2$ should have $8-1=7$ zeros. To prove this, we note that $99,\\!999,\\!999=10^8-1$, so $99,\\!999,\\!999^2=(10^8-1)^2=10^{16}-2\\cdot10^8+1$. Consider this last expression one term at a time. The first term, $10^{16}$, creates a number with 16 zeros and a one at the front. The second term, $2\\cdot10^8$, is a number with 8 zeros and a two at the front. The latter number is subtracted from the former one, so what is left is a string of 7 nines, then an eight, then 8 zeros. Finally, the last term changes the last zero of the number to a one. Thus, we are left with $\\boxed{7}$ zeros.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the pattern we observe in the number of zeros in the squares of numbers like 9, 99, and 999?\n2. How can we use this pattern to predict the number of zeros in the expansion of $99,\\!999,\\!999^2$?\n3. Can we generalize this pattern to any number of 9's in the expansion of the square?\n4. Is it possible for this pattern to break down? If so, under what circumstances?\n5. How can we confirm our prediction about the number of zeros in $99,\\!999,\\!999^2$?\n6. Can we apply a similar line of thinking to other number patterns or mathematical concepts?"
