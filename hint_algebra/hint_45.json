    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We see that 1 is in the range of $f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c$ if and only if the equation $x^2 - 5x + c = 1$ has a real root.  We can re-write this equation as $x^2 - 5x + (c - 1) = 0$.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $(-5)^2 - 4(c - 1) = 29 - 4c$.  The quadratic has a real root if and only if the discriminant is nonnegative, so $29 - 4c \\ge 0$.  Then $c \\le 29/4$, so the largest possible value of $c$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{29}{4}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what it means for a value to be in the range of a function?\n2. What is the significance of finding the largest value of c such that 1 is in the range of f(x)?\n3. Can you explain how to determine if a specific value is in the range of the function f(x)? \n4. How would you approach finding the range of f(x) in general?\n5. If the largest value of c for which 1 is in the range of f(x) is determined, how would you verify that it is indeed the largest value?\n6. Can you think of any other functions where finding a specific value in the range is important? How would you approach those cases?"
