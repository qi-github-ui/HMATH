    "problem": "Let $f(x) = ax+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are real constants, and $g(x) = 2x - 5$. Suppose that for all $x$, it is true that $g(f(x)) = 3x + 4$. What is $a+b$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "While we can solve for $a$ and $b$ individually, it is simpler to note that $f(1) = a + b$. Thus, substituting $1$ into the given equation, we obtain $$g(f(1)) = 3 \\cdot 1 + 4 = 7.$$ Thus, $$g(f(1)) = 2 \\cdot f(1) - 5 = 7 \\Longrightarrow f(1) = \\boxed{6}.$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the composition $g(f(x))$ means in this context?\n2. What does it mean for the equation $g(f(x)) = 3x + 4$ to hold for all $x$?\n3. Can you simplify the expression $g(f(x))$ using the given functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$?\n4. By comparing the simplified expression with $3x + 4$, can you determine any relationships between the coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$?\n5. If we expand $g(f(x))$ by substituting $f(x)$, what does it look like?\n6. What can we conclude about the coefficients of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ by comparing the expanded form with $3x + 4$?\n7. How can we use the coefficient relationships to determine the values of $a$ and $b$?\n8. Once we find the values of $a$ and $b$, how can we calculate $a + b$?"
