    "problem": "Suppose the function $f(x)$ is defined on the domain $\\{x_1,x_2,x_3\\}$, so that the graph of $y=f(x)$ consists of just three points. Suppose those three points form a triangle of area $32$.\n\nThe graph of $y = 2f(2x)$ also consists of just three points. What is the area of the triangle formed by those three points?",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The original graph consists of the points $(x_1,f(x_1)),$ $(x_2,f(x_2)),$ and $(x_3,f(x_3))$.\n\nThe graph of $y=2f(2x)$ consists of the points $\\left(\\frac{x_1}2,2f(x_1)\\right),$ $\\left(\\frac{x_2}2,2f(x_2)\\right),$ and $\\left(\\frac{x_3}2,2f(x_3)\\right)$. Relative to the original graph, it is stretched vertically by a factor of $2$, but also compressed horizontally by the same factor. The vertical transformation doubles the area of the triangle formed by the three points, but the horizontal transformation halves it again, so the final area is equal to the original $\\boxed{32}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the function $f(x)$ and its behavior on the domain $\\{x_1,x_2,x_3\\}$?\n2. How can we determine the coordinates of the three points that form the triangle on the graph of $y=f(x)$?\n3. What is the relationship between the graph of $y=f(x)$ and the area of the triangle formed by the three points?\n4. How does the function $y=2f(2x)$ relate to the function $y=f(x)$? Can you explain how the transformations affect the graph?\n5. Given that $y=2f(2x)$ also consists of three points, how can we find the coordinates of these new points?\n6. What can we say about the area of the triangle formed by the three points on the graph of $y=2f(2x)$? How does it relate to the original area of 32?"
