    "problem": "A shirt regularly priced at $\\$30$ is on sale for $20\\%$ off. Mary has a coupon that will take another $25\\%$ off of the sale price. What single percent discount would give the same final price as the two successive discounts?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Applying a $20\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $1-20\\%=1-0.2=\\frac{4}{5}$.  Similarly, applying a $25\\%$ discount is equivalent to multiplying by $\\frac{3}{4}$.  Applying both discounts, we multiply by $\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{3}{5}=0.6$.  Since $1-0.6=0.4=40\\%$, multiplying by 0.6 gives a $\\boxed{40\\%}$ discount.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. How would you calculate the price after the first discount of $20\\%$ off?\n3. What would be the price after applying the coupon that gives an additional $25\\%$ off?\n4. To find the single percent discount that would result in the same final price, what approach would you take?\n5. If you x represent the single percent discount, how would you set up and solve an equation to find its value?\n6. Can you think of any other scenarios where multiple discounts are involved and a single percent discount can be calculated?"
