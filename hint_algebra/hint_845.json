    "problem": "How many ounces of pure water must be added to $30$ ounces of a $30\\%$ solution of acid to yield a solution that is $20\\%$ acid?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Suppose that the number of ounces of pure water necessary is equal to $w$. Then, the total amount of liquid in the mixture is $30 + w$. The acid content of the mixture will always be $30\\% \\times 30 = 9$ ounces of acid. Thus, the amount of acid in the mixture is equal to $\\frac{9}{30 + w}$. Setting this equal to $20\\% = \\frac 15$, it follows that $$\\frac{9}{30+w} = \\frac 15 \\Longrightarrow 30+w = 45.$$ Thus, $w = \\boxed{15}$ ounces of pure water.",
