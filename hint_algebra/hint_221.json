    "problem": "The height of a ball when it is thrown off a cliff can be represented by the equation $h=45-7t-6t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds. In how many seconds will the ball reach a height of 25 feet?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If we plug in 25 for $h$, we get \\begin{align*} 25& =45-7t-6t^2\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6t^2+7t-20& =0\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad (3t-4)(2t+5)& =0\n\\end{align*}The two possible values of $t$ are $\\frac43$, and $-\\frac52$. Since the time can only be a positive value, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\frac43}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we interpret the equation $h=45-7t-6t^2$ in the context of the problem?\n2. What does the coefficient of $t^2$ tell us about the shape of the trajectory of the ball?\n3. What does the coefficient of $t$ tell us about the initial velocity of the ball and its direction?\n4. How can we find the time when the ball reaches a height of 25 feet using this equation?\n5. Can we solve this equation by factoring, or do we need to use another method? Why?\n6. What steps can we take to solve this equation and find the time it takes for the ball to reach 25 feet?\n7. How can we verify our answer to ensure it is correct?\n8. Are there any other equations in physics or other fields that can be solved using similar steps and reasoning?"
