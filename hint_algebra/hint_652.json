    "solution": "The sum of an infinite geometric series with first term $a$ and common ratio $r$ is $\\frac{a}{1-r}$.  Thus the sum of the first series is\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{2}}$$And the sum of the second series is\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{2}}$$Multiplying these, we get\n\n$$\\frac{1}{1-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2}=\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{4}}$$So $x=\\boxed{4}$.",
