    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$1<\\frac54<2$, so the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\\frac54$ is $2$. Similarly, $-2<-\\frac54<-1$, so the largest integer less than or equal to $-\\frac54$ is $-2$. The original expression, $\\left\\lceil{\\frac54}\\right\\rceil+\\left\\lfloor{-\\frac54}\\right\\rfloor$, is equal to the sum of the two, which is just $2+(-2)=\\boxed{0}$.",
