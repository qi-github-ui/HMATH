    "problem": "Given that the point $(4,7)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, there is one point that must be on the graph of $2y=3f(4x)+5$. What is the sum of the coordinates of that point?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $(4,7)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x)$, we know  \\[7=f(4).\\]Using that $f(4\\cdot1)=7$, we can also say \\[3f(4\\cdot1)+5=3\\cdot7+5=26=2\\cdot13.\\]Therefore $(x,y)=(1,13)$ is on the graph of  \\[2y=3f(4\\cdot x)+5.\\]The sum of these coordinates is $1+13=\\boxed{14}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain how the given point being on the graph of $y=f(x)$ relates to the graph of $2y=3f(4x)+5$?\n2. What does it mean for a point to be on the graph of a function? How does this information help us in finding the point on the graph of $2y=3f(4x)+5$?\n3. What does substituting $(4,7)$ into $y=f(x)$ tell us about the value of $f(4)$? How does this relate to the equation $2y=3f(4x)+5$?\n4. What steps would you take to find the value of $f(4)$ and then determine the coordinates of the point on the graph of $2y=3f(4x)+5$?\n5. Can you determine the value of $f(4)$ by using the given point and any other information given in the problem? How would you do this?\n6. Once you have the value of $f(4)$, how can you use it to find the coordinates of the point on the graph of $2y=3f(4x)+5$? What mathematical operations would you use?\n7. Now that you have the coordinates of the point on the graph of $2y=3f(4x)+5$, what is the sum of these coordinates?"
