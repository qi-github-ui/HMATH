    "problem": "A line segment begins at $(1, 3)$. It is 5 units long and ends at the point $(4, x)$ and $x > 0$. What is the value of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the distance formula: $$\\sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (x - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + (x - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 - 6x + 18} = 5.$$ Squaring both sides and rearranging terms, we find that \\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 6x + 18 &= 25 \\\\\nx^2 - 6x - 7 &= 0\\\\\n(x - 7)(x + 1) &= 0\n\\end{align*} Thus, $x = 7$ or $x = -1$. We are given that $x > 0$, so $x = \\boxed{7}$.\n\n- OR -\n\nNote that the points $(1, 3)$, $(4, 3)$, and $(4, x)$ form a right triangle. We are given that one of the legs has length 3 and the hypotenuse has length 5. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the last leg must have length 4. Therefore, $x = 3 - 4 = -1$ or $x = 3 + 4 = 7$. Since $x > 0$, we find that $x = \\boxed{7}$.",
