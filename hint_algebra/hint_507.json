    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, we combine the fraction on the left to give $\\frac{5x-3}{x+3} = \\frac{1}{x+3}$.  Then, multiplying both sides by $x+3$ gets rid of the denominators and leaves $5x-3 = 1$.  Adding 3 to both sides gives $5x=4$, so $x = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step to solve this equation?\n2. To solve this equation, do you know any different methods that can be used?\n3. If you choose to multiply both sides of the equation by $(x+3)$, what do you get? Why is multiplying by $(x+3)$ a good choice?\n4. Can you simplify the equation after multiplying both sides by $(x+3)$? What does the equation look like now?\n5. What values of $x$ make the denominator $(x+3)$ equal to zero? Why do we need to avoid these values?\n6. After simplifying the equation, what is the resulting polynomial equation? Can you factorize it?\n7. If you factorize the polynomial equation, what are the factors? How can you use these factors to find the solutions?\n8.
