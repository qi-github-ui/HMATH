    "problem": "Suppose $f(x)$ is a function defined for all real $x$, and suppose $f$ is invertible (that is, $f^{-1}(x)$ exists for all $x$ in the range of $f$).\n\nIf the graphs of $y=f(x^2)$ and $y=f(x^4)$ are drawn, at how many points do they intersect?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "There is a point of intersection for each $x$ such that $f(x^2)=f(x^4)$. Since $f$ is invertible, this equation is satisfied only if $x^2=x^4$, so we simply count solutions to that equation. We can rearrange the equation $x^2=x^4$ as follows: \\begin{align*}\n0 &= x^4-x^2 \\\\\n0 &= x^2(x^2-1) \\\\\n0 &= x^2(x+1)(x-1)\n\\end{align*}The last factorization shows that the solutions are $x=-1,0,1$. Therefore, the graphs of $y=f(x^2)$ and $y=f(x^4)$ must intersect at exactly $\\boxed{3}$ points.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you graph the functions $y=f(x^2)$ and $y=f(x^4)$? \n2. Can you explain the concept of inverting a function and what it means for $f$ to be invertible? \n3. What does it mean for two graphs to intersect? \n4. How can we determine the points of intersection between these two graphs? \n5. Are there any specific values of $x$ for which $f(x^2)=f(x^4)$? \n6. How does the concept of even and odd exponents relate to the problem at hand? \n7. Can you think of any other examples where we might encounter similar situations or questions related to intersecting graphs?"
