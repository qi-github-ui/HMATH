    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have the equation $\\frac{3+x}{5+x}=\\frac{1+x}{2+x}$. Simplifying, we get \\begin{align*}\n(3+x)(2+x)&=(5+x)(1+x)\\\\\n6+5x+x^2&=5+6x+x^2\\\\\nx&=\\boxed{1}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. Are there any restrictions or conditions on the values of x that we need to consider for this problem?\n3. Can you think of any techniques or approaches that could help us solve the equation $\\frac{3+x}{5+x} = \\frac{1+x}{2+x}$?\n4. If we were to cross-multiply and solve the resulting equation, what strategies could we employ to simplify the equation?\n5. How would you verify that the value of x we find actually satisfies the equation?\n6. Can you think of any other types of equations where a similar approach or line of thinking could be applied?"
