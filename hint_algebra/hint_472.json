    "problem": "A ball is dropped from 10 feet high and always bounces back up half the distance it just fell. After how many bounces will the ball first reach a maximum height less than 1 foot?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have a geometric sequence with first term 10 and common ratio $1/2$. Any term in this sequence can be represented as $10\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k$, where $k$ is the number of bounces (for example, when $k=1$, $10\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k=5$, or the height of the $k=1^\\text{st}$ bounce). We need to find the smallest $k$ such that $10\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k<1$. Through trial and error, we find that $k=4$, so it takes $\\boxed{4}$ bounces for the maximum height to be less than 1 foot.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you describe the initial step in solving this problem?\n2. What do you understand by \"maximum height\" in this context?\n3. Can you determine the height of the ball after the first bounce? How about after the second bounce?\n4. Is there a pattern that you notice in the heights of the ball after each bounce?\n5. How would you represent the number of bounces and the corresponding height of the ball in a mathematical equation or expression?\n6. Can you devise a general formula or rule that relates the number of bounces to the maximum height the ball reaches?\n7. How can you use this formula to determine the number of bounces it takes for the ball to reach a maximum height less than 1 foot?\n8. Are there any assumptions or constraints that need to be considered in solving this problem?"
