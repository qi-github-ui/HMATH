    "problem": "If $x@y=xy-2x$, what is the value of $(7@4)-(4@7)$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$7@4=7\\cdot4-2\\cdot7=14$ and $4@7=4\\cdot7-2\\cdot4=20$, so $(7@4)-(4@7)=14-20=\\boxed{-6}$. Another way to solve this problem is to realize that the expression $(7@4)-(4@7)$ is of the form $(x@y)-(y@x)=xy-2x-yx+2y=-2x+2y$, so the expression is just equal to $-2\\cdot7+2\\cdot4=\\boxed{-6}$.",
