    "solution": "All points on the line $x=-3$ are of the form $(-3,y)$, where $y$ is a real number.  The distance from $(5,2)$ to $(-3,y)$ is $$\\sqrt{(5-(-3))^2+(2-y)^2}$$ units.  Setting this expression equal to 10, we find \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(5-(-3))^2+(2-y)^2}&= 10 \\\\\n64+(2-y)^2&= 100 \\\\\n(2-y)^2&= 36 \\\\\n2-y&=\\pm 6 \\\\\ny=2\\pm6.\n\\end{align*} The product of $2+6 = 8$ and $2-6 = -4$ is $\\boxed{-32}$.

    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean for a point to lie on the line $x=-3$? Can you explain in your own words?\n2. How can we express the distance between two points algebraically? Can you come up with an equation that represents the distance between point $P$ and $(5,2)$?\n3. What does it mean for the distance between point $P$ and $(5,2)$ to be 10 units? How can we write this relationship mathematically?\n4. Using the equation you derived in question 2, can you substitute $x=-3$ and solve for the possible $y$-coordinates of point $P$? \n5. What are the possible values of $y$ that satisfy the equation? How did you arrive at those values?\n6. Is there any restriction or condition on the $y$-coordinates that we should consider? If so, how does it affect the possible values?\n7. What is the product of all the possible $y$-coordinates that satisfy the given conditions? Can you explain how you obtained this result?"
