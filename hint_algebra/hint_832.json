    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that $7\\bowtie g = 7+\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+...}}}=9$. Therefore, $$\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+...}}}=2.$$ Because the series of $\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+...}}}$ is infinite, we can substitute $2$ into the series for any $\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+...}}}$ we want. Thus, $$\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+...}}}=2$$ implies that $$\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+\\sqrt{g+...}}}=\\sqrt{g+2}=2.$$ Squaring both sides of this new equality, we have $g+2=4$, or $g=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of the operation $\\bowtie$?\n2. Can you explain how the operation $\\bowtie$ is being applied repeatedly in the expression $a+\\sqrt{b+\\sqrt{b+\\sqrt{b+...}}}$?\n3. What is the value of $7\\bowtie g$ in terms of $g$?\n4. Given that $7\\bowtie g = 9$, can you set up an equation to solve for the value of $g$?\n5. How can you isolate the variable $g$ in the equation you set up?\n6. What is the value of $g$ when you solve the equation from the previous step?"
