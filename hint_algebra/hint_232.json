    "problem": "A 1$\\%$ late charge was added to Jenna's bill on the $30^{\\text{th}}$ day past its due date. The resulting total was then increased by 1$\\%$ because she did not pay the bill in the next 30 days either. Her original bill was $\\$400$. Exactly how much is the bill now?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The first late charge brings the bill to $400 \\cdot 1.01 = 400 + 4 = 404$. The second late charge brings the bill to $404 \\cdot 1.01 = 404 + 4.04 = \\boxed{408.04}$ dollars.\n\n-OR-\n\nEach increase multiples the bill by $1+1\\%=1.01$. Therefore, her final bill is $\\$400(1.01)^2=\\$408.04$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you identify the main concept being discussed in this question?\n2. What is the meaning of a \"1% late charge\" added to Jenna's bill?\n3. How can we calculate the amount of the late charge?\n4. What does it mean when it says \"the resulting total was then increased by 1%\"?\n5. How can we calculate the increase in the total amount?\n6. What is Jenna's original bill amount and how does it relate to the total amount after the late charge and subsequent increase?\n7. Can you outline the step-by-step process to calculate the final bill amount?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios where a similar process might be applied?\n9. What would happen if the late charge percentage or the subsequent increase percentage were different?\n10. How would you express the final bill amount in mathematical notation?\n11. How would you verify the accuracy of your calculations?\n12. Can you generalize the process outlined here to handle similar situations in the future?"
