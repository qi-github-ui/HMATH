    "problem": "Let $f(x)=2\\sqrt{x} + \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{x}}$ and let $g(x)=2x^2-2x-3$. What is $f(g(3))$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We first evaluate $g(3) = 2\\cdot3^2 - 2\\cdot3-3=9$. Therefore $f(g(3))=f(9)=2\\sqrt{9} + \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{9}}= 2\\cdot3 + \\frac{12}{3}=\\boxed{10}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the function $f(x)$ represents? What about the function $g(x)$?\n2. When evaluating $f(g(3))$, what does it mean to plug in $3$ as the input for $g(x)$?\n3. What steps do you need to take to evaluate $g(3)$? What will be the result of this evaluation?\n4. Once you have the result of $g(3)$, how does that value affect the expression $f(x)$?\n5. Can you simplify the expression $f(g(3))$ by substituting the value you found for $g(3)$?\n6. What is the final value of $f(g(3))$? What does this result represent in the context of the problem?"
