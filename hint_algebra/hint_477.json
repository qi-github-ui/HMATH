    "solution": "Let $y = f(x)$. Then, $f(f(x)) = f(y) = 5$, so either $x^2 - 4 = 5$ or $x + 3 = 5$. Solving the first equations yields that $y = f(x) = \\pm 3$, both of which are greater than or equal to $-4$. The second equation yields that $y = 2$, but we discard this solution because $y \\ge -4$.\n\nHence $f(x) = \\pm 3$, so $x^2 - 4 = \\pm 3$ or $x + 3 = \\pm 3$. The first equation yields that $x = \\pm 1, \\pm \\sqrt{7}$, all of which are greater than or equal to $-4$. The second equation yields that $x = -6, 0$, of which only the first value, $x = -6$, is less than $-4$. Hence, there are $\\boxed{5}$ values of $x$ that satisfy $f(f(x)) = 5$: $x = -6, -\\sqrt{7}, -1, 1, \\sqrt{7}$, as we can check.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what $f(x)$ represents for values of $x$ that are greater than or equal to $-4$? And how about for values of $x$ that are less than $-4$?\n2. How would you approach finding the values of $x$ for which $f(f(x)) = 5$? What steps would you take?\n3. What do you think $f(f(x)) = 5$ implies about the values of $x$? In other words, what kind of values for $x$ would satisfy this equation?\n4. Can you determine the conditions under which $f(f(x)) = 5$ could be satisfied based on the different cases defined for $f(x)$? What are the ranges of $x$ where each case is valid?\n5. For each case (where $f(x)$ takes on a different form), can you find the values of $x$ that satisfy $f(f(x)) = 5$? How would you go about solving each case separately?\n6. Are there any values of $x$ that satisfy $f(f(x)) = 5$ in both cases (where $x\\geq-4$ and $x<-4$)? If so, how would you identify and verify them?\n7. Can you think of any other types of equations where similar thinking and steps might be useful in finding the solutions?\n8. What insights have you gained from this process of solving $f(f(x)) = 5$ that could be applied to other problems involving composite functions?"
