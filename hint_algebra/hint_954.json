    "solution": "We approach this problem by working from the inside out, so we first find $f(17)$. Since $17 \\geq 7$, $f(17) = 17 - 13 = 4$. Next, $4<7$, so $f(f(17))=f(4)=(4)^2-4=12$. Finally we have that since $12 \\geq 7$, $f(f(f(17)))=f(12)=12-13=\\boxed{-1}$.",

What is the value of f(17) according to the given function definition?\n4. What is the input value for the second function, f(f(17)), and how does the function behave when x is less than 7?\n5.
