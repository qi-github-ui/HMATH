    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $\\frac1{13}=13^{-1}$, we can express $\\left(\\frac{1}{13}\\right)^{n-24}$ as $13^{-n+24}$. We have that $13^{3n}=\\left(\\frac{1}{13}\\right)^{n-24}=13^{-n+24}$, so setting the exponents equal we find that $3n=-n+24$, or $n=\\frac{24}{4}=\\boxed{6}$.",
