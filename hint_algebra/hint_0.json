    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must \"meet\" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \\Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\\boxed{0}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a piecewise function is and how it is represented algebraically?\n2. How would you determine if the given piecewise function is continuous at the points where different functions are used?\n3. What conditions need to be satisfied for a piecewise function to be continuous?\n4. Can you identify the value of $a$ and $b$ that would make the piecewise function continuous?\n5. How would you approach solving for $a$ and $b$ in order to make the function continuous?\n6. Are there any restrictions or constraints on the values of $a$ and $b$ that need to be considered for the function to be continuous?\n7. Can you explain the significance of a continuous function in real-life applications or mathematical concepts?\n8. Can you think of any other examples of piecewise functions or situations where continuity is important?"
