    "problem": "On an algebra test, there were $5x$ problems. Lucky Lacy missed $x$ of them. What percent of the problems did she get correct?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If Lucky Lacy missed $x$ out of $5x$ problems, then she must have gotten $5x-x=4x$ of them correct. Therefore, the percentage of problems that Lacy got correct is  $\\frac{4x}{5x}=\\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{80}{100}=\\boxed{80 \\%}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many total problems were on the algebra test?\n2. How many problems did Lucky Lacy miss?\n3. What expression represents the number of problems Lucky Lacy got correct?\n4. How can we express the percent of problems Lucky Lacy got correct as a ratio of the problems she got correct to the total number of problems? \n5. Can we simplify the expression by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by a common factor? \n6. How can we express the percent as a decimal or a fraction? \n7. Can we convert the decimal or fraction to a percentage?"
