    "problem": "The equation $y=-16t^2+22t+45$ describes the height (in feet) of a ball thrown upwards at $22$ feet per second from $45$ feet above the ground. Find the time (in seconds) when the ball will hit the ground. Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The equation $y=-16t^2+22t+45$ can be rewritten as $y=(8t+9)(-2t+5)$. Because $t$ needs to be positive, set $-2t+5=0$ to represent the point where the ball reaches the ground. Therefore: \\begin{align*}\n-2t+5&=0\\\\\n-2t&=-5\\\\\n2t&=5\\\\\nt&=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}\n\\end{align*}",
