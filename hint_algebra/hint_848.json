    "problem": "There are 12 ordered pairs of integers $(x,y)$ that satisfy $x^2 + y^2 = 25$. What is the greatest possible sum $x+y$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The graph of $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ is a circle centered at $(0,0)$ of radius $\\sqrt{25}=5$.  Beginning at $(-5, 0)$ and working our way around the circle, we have the following 12 points on the circle:\n\n$(-5, 0)$, $(-4, 3)$, $(-3, 4)$, $(0, 5)$, $(3, 4)$, $(4, 3)$, $(5, 0)$, $(4, -3)$, $(3, -4)$, $(0, -5)$, $(-3, -4)$, $(-4, -3)$.\n\nThe greatest possible sum for any of these pairs is $3+4=\\boxed{7}$.\n\n(Of course, you could probably have guess-checked this answer relatively easily, but recognizing the equation as the graph of a circle is helpful in convincing yourself that there is no greater value of $x+y$ ... or, for example, if you wanted to find the greatest possible value of $x+y$, which is $5\\sqrt2$).",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we start solving this problem? What do we know about the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$ and what can we infer from it?\n2. What are the possible values for $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 25$? \n3. How can we determine which of these possible values of $x$ and $y$ form ordered pairs of integers?\n4. Can we find a systematic way to identify all 12 ordered pairs of integers $(x,y)$ that satisfy $x^2 + y^2 = 25$?\n5. How can we find the sum $x+y$ for each of the 12 ordered pairs of integers that satisfy the equation? \n6. Is there a way to determine the greatest possible sum $x+y$ without explicitly calculating the sum for each of the 12 pairs?\n7. What insights or patterns do we observe when examining all the ordered pairs of integers that satisfy $x^2 + y^2 = 25$?\n8. How can we determine the maximum value of $x+y$ from the observed patterns or insights? Is there a general approach we can use?\n9. Can we justify that the maximum sum $x+y$ obtained is indeed the greatest possible sum for the given equation?\n10. Are there any similar mathematical problems or equations that can be approached using similar reasoning or steps?\n11. Can we generalize this problem and apply the learned concepts to other equations or situations?\n12. How can we further deepen our understanding of algebraic concepts and problem-solving strategies through solving and analyzing problems like this?"
