    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We see that $-2$ is in the range of $f(x) = x^2 + 3x + c$ if and only if the equation $x^2+3x+c=-2$ has a real root.  We can re-write this equation as $x^2 + 3x + (c + 2) = 0$.  The discriminant of this quadratic is $3^2 - 4(c + 2) = 1 - 4c$.  The quadratic has a real root if and only if the discriminant is nonnegative, so $1 - 4c \\ge 0$.  Then $c \\le 1/4$, so the largest possible value of $c$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you identify the purpose of finding the largest value of $c$ such that $-2$ is in the range of $f(x)=x^2+3x+c$?\n2. What is the definition or meaning of the \"range\" of a function? How does it relate to the problem at hand?\n3. How can we determine if a specific value, such as $-2$, is in the range of a given quadratic function?\n4. Can you express the given quadratic function $f(x)$ in vertex form? How might this form help us in identifying the largest possible value of $c$?\n5. What is the vertex of the parabola represented by $f(x)$? How does the value of $c$ affect the position of the vertex?\n6. How does the sign of the coefficient of the $x^2$ term impact the shape of the parabola? Can you describe how it relates to the range of the function?\n7. What would happen if we shifted the entire graph of $f(x)$ vertically? How does this affect the range of the function?\n8. Can you think of any other techniques or principles from algebra that might be helpful in solving this problem?\n9. Are there any other constraints or limitations that we need to consider when determining the largest value of $c$?"
