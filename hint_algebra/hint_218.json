    "solution": "We begin by looking at each of the two possible cases; either $x<2$ and $f(x)=9x+16=-2$, or $x\\ge2$ and $f(x)=2x-14=-2$. Tackling the first case, we find that if $9x+16=-2$, then $x=-\\frac{18}{9}=-2$. Since this also satisfies the condition $x<2$, this is our first possible value of $x$. In the second case, we see that if $2x-14=-2$, then $x=\\frac{12}{2}=6$. Since this also satisfies the condition $x\\ge2$, this is our second possible value for $x$. The sum of these two values is just $-2+6=\\boxed{4}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of the function f(x) in this problem?\n2. Can you identify the conditions or constraints for the values of x in the function definition?\n3. What is the first step you would take to find the values of x when f(x) = -2?\n4. Can you identify any possible methods or strategies for solving this equation?\n5. If you choose to solve it graphically, how would you plot the function to find its intersection with the value -2?\n6. What is the significance of the conditions given in the function definition? How does it affect the possible values of x?\n7. Can you express the function f(x) as a composite function or combination of two separate functions for different ranges of x?\n8. How can you determine the possible values of x by analyzing the different cases defined in the function?\n9. Once you find the possible values of x, how would you calculate their sum?\n10. Can you think of any similar scenarios where you might encounter such conditions or constraints when finding the sum of possible values in an equation?"
