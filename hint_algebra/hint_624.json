    "solution": "Since the quadratic has only one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero. The discriminant is $b^2-4ac=64-4ac=0$, so $ac=\\frac{64}{4}=16$. We need to find $a$ and $c$ given $a+c=10$ and $ac=16$. We could write a quadratic equation and solve, but instead we rely on clever algebraic manipulations: Since $a+c=10$, we have $$(a+c)^2=a^2+c^2+2ac=10^2=100.$$We subtract $4ac=64$ from each side to find $$a^2+c^2+2ac-4ac=a^2+c^2-2ac=100-64=36.$$We recognize each side as a square, so we take the square root of both sides: $$\\sqrt{a^2+c^2-2ac}=\\sqrt{(c-a)^2}=c-a=\\sqrt{36}=6.$$(Technically we should take the positive and negative square root of both sides, but since $c>a$ we know $c-a>0$.) Thus we have  \\begin{align*}\nc-a&=6\\\\\nc+a&=10\n\\end{align*}Summing these equations gives \\begin{align*}\n2c&=16\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad c&=8,\n\\end{align*}and $a=10-c=2$. Thus our ordered pair $(a,c)$ is $\\boxed{(2,8)}$.",
