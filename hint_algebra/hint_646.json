    "problem": "If a school bus leaves school with 48 students on board, and one-half of the students get off the bus at each of the first three stops, how many students remain on the bus after the third stop?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "At each stop, the number of students on the bus is cut in half. Therefore, after 3 stops, the number of students on the bus is $48(\\frac12)^3 = \\frac{48}8 = \\boxed{6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you identify the initial number of students on the school bus?\n2. How many students will get off at the first stop, considering that one-half of the students are getting off?\n3. After the first stop, how many students will be on the bus?\n4. At the second stop, how many students will get off, based on the same one-half reduction rule?\n5. After the second stop, how many students will remain on the bus?\n6. Following the same pattern, can you determine how many students will get off at the third stop?\n7. Finally, after the third stop, how many students will be left on the bus?"
