    "problem": "The range of the function $g(x) = \\frac{2}{2+4x^2}$ can be written as an interval $(a,b]$. What is $a+b$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The denominator, $2+4x^2$, takes all values greater than or equal to $2$. Therefore, $\\frac{2}{2+4x^2}$ is at most $\\frac 22=1$, and can take any positive value smaller than this. So, the range of $g(x)$ is $(0,1]$, which gives $a+b=\\boxed{1}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the function $g(x)$ represents and how it is defined?\n2. What is the purpose of finding the range of a function? How does it help us understand the behavior of the function?\n3. How do you approach determining the range of a function? Are there any specific steps or strategies that you use?\n4. Can you describe the limitations or restrictions, if any, on the values that $x$ can take in this function?\n5. What is the significance of the fraction $\\frac{2}{2+4x^2}$ in the function $g(x)$? What does it tell us about the range?\n6. How would you begin finding the range of the function $g(x)$? What initial observations or insights can you make?\n7. What do you think the interval notation $(a,b]$ implies about the range of the function? Can you explain why we use this notation instead of other possibilities like $(a,b)$ or [a,b]?\n8. How do you determine the lower bound of the range, denoted as $a$ in the interval $(a,b]$? What calculations or reasoning do you employ?\n9. Similarly, how do you determine the upper bound of the range, denoted as $b$ in the interval $(a,b]$? What steps or methods can be used to find this value?\n10. Once you have obtained the values for $a$ and $b$, how would you compute their sum $a+b$ to find the final answer?"
