    "problem": "A line containing the points $(2, 16)$ and $(-8, -4)$ intersects the $y$-axis at what point?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The $y$-axis has equation $x = 0$.  Thus we need to find out what $y$ is when $x = 0$.  We notice that the slope of the line is $\\frac{16 - (-4)}{2 - (-8)} = 2$.  So to get to $x = 0$ we can start at $(2, 16)$ and go left two in the $x$ direction.  Since the slope of the line is $2$ we know that going left in $x$ by one results in going down in $y$ by two (i.e. $y$ will be 12).  Thus the line intercepts the $y$-axis at $\\boxed{(0, 12)}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what it means for a line to intersect the $y$-axis?\n2. How can we determine the equation of a line given two points on the line?\n3. What are the coordinates of the $y$-intercept in a linear equation?\n4. If we substitute the coordinates of the $y$-intercept into the equation of the line, what should the result be?\n5. How can we find the equation of a line that passes through two given points?\n6. What process should we follow to find the $y$-intercept of the given line?\n7. Can you identify the slope of the line passing through the given points? Why is it useful for finding the $y$-intercept?\n8. How does the slope-intercept form of a linear equation relate to finding the $y$-intercept?\n9. What are the coordinates of the $y$-intercept for the line passing through the points $(2, 16)$ and $(-8, -4)$?\n10. How can you verify that the point you found is indeed the $y$-intercept of the line?"
