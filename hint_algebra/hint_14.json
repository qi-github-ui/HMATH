    "problem": "Sixteen is 64$\\%$ of what number?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the number is $x$, we can set up the equation $\\frac{16}{x}=\\frac{64}{100}$. We divide both sides by $4$ to get $\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{4}{100}=\\frac{1}{25}$, so $x=\\boxed{25}$.",
