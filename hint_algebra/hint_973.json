    "problem": "If $x$ is a positive number such that \\[\\sqrt{8x}\\cdot\\sqrt{10x}\\cdot\\sqrt{3x}\\cdot\\sqrt{15x}=15,\\]find all possible values for $x$.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Combining the expressions on the left-hand side, we obtain \\[\\begin{aligned} \\sqrt{8x}\\cdot\\sqrt{10x}\\cdot\\sqrt{3x}\\cdot\\sqrt{15x}&=15 \\\\ \n\\sqrt{3600x^4} &= 15 \\\\\n60x^2 &= 15 \\\\\nx^2 &= \\frac{15}{60} = \\frac{1}{4}.\\end{aligned} \\]Since $x$ must be positive, the only solution is $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step you would take in solving this equation?\n2. Can you explain why we need to find the square root of each term on both sides of the equation?\n3. How can we simplify the left-hand side of the equation after taking the square root of each term?\n4. Why does taking the square root of a product result in each term being individually square rooted?\n5. What does the equation look like after simplifying the left-hand side using the properties of square roots?\n6. How can we solve the simplified equation to find the possible values of x?\n7. Are there any restrictions on the possible values of x, considering that it is a positive number?\n8. Can you explain why each of the possible values for x satisfies the given equation?\n9. Can you think of any other types of equations where a similar approach of simplifying and solving using square roots could be applied?\n10. In what other mathematical situations might the concept of square roots be important?"
