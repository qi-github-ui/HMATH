    "problem": "What is the length of the segment of the number line whose endpoints satisfy $|x-\\sqrt[5]{16}|=3$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $x-\\sqrt[5]{16}=3$ or $x-\\sqrt[5]{16}=-3$. Our two solutions are $x=\\sqrt[5]{16}+3$ and $x=\\sqrt[5]{16}-3$. These are the endpoints of the segment, and we need to find the length, so take the larger minus the smaller: $(\\sqrt[5]{16}+3)-(\\sqrt[5]{16}-3)=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you rephrase the given equation in a simpler way?\n2. How would you interpret the expression $|x - \\sqrt[5]{16}| = 3$ geometrically?\n3. What does the equation tell you about the possible values of $x$?\n4. Can you identify the two potential values for $x$ based on the given equation?\n5. How would you find the distance between these two values on the number line?\n6. Is there any relationship between the distance on the number line and the absolute value equation?\n7. Can you generalize your findings to other similar absolute value equations?"
