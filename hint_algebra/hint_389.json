What fraction of the total area does the shaded area represent in the first iteration?\n4. Can you see any patterns in the relationship between the number of smaller squares in each iteration and the total area they cover?\n5. If the pattern continues indefinitely, what can you say about the total area covered by the shaded squares?\n6. How can we express the fractional part of the figure that is shaded?"
