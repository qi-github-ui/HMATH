    "problem": "What is the remainder when the sum of the first 102 counting numbers is divided by 5250?  (The first counting number is 1.)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \\dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $1 + 2 + \\dots + 102 = 102 \\cdot 103/2 = 5253$.  The remainder when 5253 is divided by 5250 is $\\boxed{3}$.",
