    "problem": "The graph of $y=\\frac{5x^2-9}{3x^2+5x+2}$ has vertical asymptotes at $x = a$ and $x = b$.  Find $a + b$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The vertical asymptotes will occur when the denominator of a simplified rational expression is equal to zero. We factor the denominator $3x^2+5x+2$ to obtain $(3x+2)(x+1)$.  Hence, there are vertical asymptotes when $x=-1,-\\frac{2}{3}$, and the sum of these values of $x$ is $-1-\\frac{2}{3}=\\boxed{-\\frac{5}{3}.}$\n\n(We can also use Vieta's formulas, which states that the sum of the roots of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $-b/a$.)",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what vertical asymptotes are and how they relate to the graph of a rational function?\n2. How can we determine the vertical asymptotes of the given function algebraically?\n3. What is the relationship between the vertical asymptotes and the factors in the denominator of the rational function?\n4. Can you factor the denominator and identify any common factors that might contribute to the vertical asymptotes?\n5. How can we determine the values of $a$ and $b$ from the factored form of the denominator?\n6. Can you explain why the graph of the given function has vertical asymptotes at $x = a$ and $x = b$?\n7. Are there any restrictions or conditions for the function that might affect the existence of vertical asymptotes?\n8. Can you think of any other rational functions where finding the vertical asymptotes would involve a similar thought process and steps?"
