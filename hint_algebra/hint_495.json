    "problem": "The length of the segment between the points $(2a, a-4)$ and $(4, -1)$ is $2\\sqrt{10}$ units. What is the product of all possible values for $a$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "By the distance formula, the distance from $(2a, a-4)$ to $(4, -1)$ is $\\sqrt{(2a-4)^2+((a-4)-(-1))^2}$.  Setting this equal to $2\\sqrt{10}$, we find \\begin{align*}\n(2a-4)^2+(a-3)^2 &= \\sqrt{40}^2\\\\\n4a^2-16a+16+a^2-6a+9&= 40\\\\\n5a^2-22a-15&=0\\\\\n(a-5)(5a+3)&=0\n\\end{align*}The possible values for $a$ are $5$ and $-\\frac{3}{5}$. Thus, the answer is $5\\times-\\frac{3}{5}=\\boxed{-3}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the steps you would take to find the length of the segment between the two given points?\n2. Are there any different approaches or methods you can think of to solve this problem?\n3. If you choose to use the distance formula, what would be the equation you set up to find the length of the segment?\n4. Why does the given length of the segment lead us to consider the distance formula as a suitable method? What characteristics of the problem make this approach appropriate?\n5. Once you set up the equation, how would you solve it algebraically? Can you demonstrate the steps and explain each one?\n6. Is it possible to have multiple values for 'a' that satisfy the equation? If so, what are they, and how do you determine the product of all possible values?\n7. Can you think of any other mathematical problems or scenarios where a similar approach involving segment length might be relevant? How would you adapt your thinking and steps to solve those problems?"
