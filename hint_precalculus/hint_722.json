    "problem": "The side of a triangle are 2, 2, and $\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2}.$  Enter the angles of the triangle in degrees, separated by commas.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "By the Law of Cosines, the cosine of one of the angles is\n\\[\\frac{2^2 + 2^2 - (\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2})^2}{2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{4 \\sqrt{3}}{8} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2},\\]so this angle is $\\boxed{30^\\circ}.$  The other two angles must be equal, so they are $\\boxed{75^\\circ, 75^\\circ}.$",
