    "socratic_questions": "1. How is the line $y=\\frac{3}{2}x-25$ parameterized by $(x,y)=(f(t),15t-7)$?\n2. Can you explain why we set $y=15t-7$ in the parameterization of the line?\n3. How did we solve for $x$ in the equation $15t-7=\\frac{3}{2}x-25$?\n4. What is the resulting function of $f(t)$ when solving for $x$ in terms of $t$?\n5. How can we verify that our answer for $f(t)$ is correct?\n6. Are there any alternative parameterizations for the same line? If so, how do they differ and which one might be more convenient to use?"
