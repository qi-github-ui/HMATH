What is the significance of the constant $c$ in the equation $y = a \\sin (bx + c)$?\n3. How does changing the value of $c$ affect the graph of $y = a \\sin (bx + c)$?\n4. In the given graph, at what value of $x$ does the graph reach its maximum point?\n5. How does the value of $c$ relate to the x-coordinate of the maximum point in the graph?\n6. For which specific value of $c$ will the maximum point occur when $x = 0$?\n7. Based on the given graph, what is the smallest possible value of $c$?\n8. Can you generalize the relationship between the graph of $y = \\sin x$ and $y = a \\sin (bx + c)$, regarding the location of the maximum point?\n9. If we were to change the values of $a$ and $b$, how would that affect the value of $c$ in the equation $y = a \\sin (bx + c)$?\n10. Can you think of any other mathematical functions that have a similar relationship between their equation and the graph, involving a constant term that affects the position of certain key points?"
