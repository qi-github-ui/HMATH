    "solution": "We can re-write the first equation as\n\\[x = \\frac{w+z}{1-wz}.\\]which is an indication to consider trigonometric substitution.\n\nLet $x = \\tan a,$ $y = \\tan b,$ $z = \\tan c,$ and $w = \\tan d,$ where $-90^{\\circ} < a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d < 90^{\\circ}$.  Then\n\\[\\tan a = \\frac{\\tan d + \\tan c}{1 - \\tan d \\tan c} = \\tan (c + d).\\]Similarly,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\tan b &= \\tan (d + a), \\\\\n\\tan c &= \\tan (a + b), \\\\\n\\tan d &= \\tan (b + c).\n\\end{align*}Since the tangent function has period $180^\\circ,$\n\\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv c + d, \\\\\nb &\\equiv d + a, \\\\\nc &\\equiv a + b, \\\\\nd &\\equiv b + c,\n\\end{align*}where all the congruences are taken modulo $180^\\circ.$  Adding all these congruences, we get $a + b + c + d \\equiv 0.$  Then\n\\[a \\equiv c + d \\equiv -a - b,\\]so $b \\equiv -2a.$  Similarly, $c \\equiv -2b,$ $d \\equiv -2c,$ and $a \\equiv -2d.$  Then\n\\[a \\equiv -2d \\equiv 4c \\equiv -8b \\equiv 16a,\\]so $15a \\equiv 0.$  Hence, $(a,b,c,d) \\equiv (t,-2t,4t,-8t),$ where $15t \\equiv 0.$  Since $a \\equiv c + d,$\n\\[t \\equiv 4t - 8t \\equiv -4t,\\]so $5t \\equiv 0.$  We can check that this condition always leads to a solution, giving us $\\boxed{5}$ solutions.\n\nNote: We divided the first equation to get\n\\[x = \\frac{w + z}{1 - wz},\\]so we should check that $wz \\neq 1$ for all five solutions.  If $wz = 1,$ then from the equation $x = z + w + zwx,$\n\\[z + w = 0.\\]Then $wz = -w^2,$ which cannot be equal to 1, contradiction.  The same holds for the division in the other equations.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this system of equations?\n2. What observation can we make about the first equation when we rewrite it as $x = \\frac{w+z}{1-wz}$? Why is this an indication to consider trigonometric substitution?\n3. If we let $x = \\tan a$, $y = \\tan b$, $z = \\tan c$, and $w = \\tan d$, how does this relate to the given system of equations?\n4. By substituting the tangent values into each of the equations, what new relationships do we see emerge?\n5. Considering the periodic nature of the tangent function, what congruences or equivalences can we establish between the variables $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$?\n6. Can you simplify the congruences we established in question 5 and find a relationship between $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$? How does this relationship restrict the possible values of the variables?\n7. How many different sets of values can we find for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ that satisfy the relationship established in question 6 and the condition $15t \\equiv 0$? How does this correspond to the number of real solutions to the system of equations?\n8. Additionally, why is it important to check that $wz \\neq 1$ for all five solutions?"
