    "problem": "A translation of the plane takes $-3 + 2i$ to $-7 - i.$  Find the complex number that the translation takes $-4 + 5i$ to.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "This translation takes $z$ to $z + w,$ where $w$ is a fixed complex number.  Thus,\n\\[-7 - i = (-3 + 2i) + w.\\]Hence, $w = -4 - 3i.$  Then the translation takes $-4 + 5i$ to $(-4 + 5i) + (-4 - 3i) = \\boxed{-8 + 2i}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you restate the problem at hand in your own words?\n2. What do you know about translations of the complex plane? How are they typically represented?\n3. What does it mean when we say a translation takes one complex number to another?\n4. Can you write down the formula for a general translation that takes $z_1$ to $z_2$? \n5. What are the components of the fixed complex number $w$ in this specific translation problem?\n6. How do you use $w$ to find the image of $-4+5i$ under this translation? \n7. Can you think of any other problems that involve translating points in the complex plane? How are the methods for solving those problems similar or different from this one?"
