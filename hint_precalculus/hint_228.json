    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain how we can rewrite the equation in terms of $x$ and $y$ coordinates using trigonometric identities?\n2. What does the equation $y - x = 1$ represent geometrically? Can you visualize it?\n3. How does the equation of a line compare to the equation of a circle? Can you think of any similarities or differences?\n4. Are there any specific properties or characteristics of a parabola that we can use to determine if the given equation represents a parabola or not?\n5. We have concluded that the equation represents a line. Can you generalize this result for other equations of the form $r = \\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta - \\cos \\theta}$? Can you find any patterns?\n6. How does the equation of a line compare to the equations of an ellipse or a hyperbola? Can you think of any specific features that differentiate them?"
