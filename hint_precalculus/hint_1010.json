Equating the vectors for the two lines, and comparing components, we obtain the system of equations\n\\begin{align*}\n1 + 2t &= 4 + 5u, \\\\\n2 + 3t &= 1 + 2u, \\\\\na + 4t &= u.\n\\end{align*}Solving, we find $t = -1,$ $u = -1,$ and $a = 3.$\n\nTherefore, the two lines are skew for $a \\neq 3,$ or $a \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,3) \\cup (3,\\infty)}.$",

How can we determine whether two lines are skew or not?\n4. What is the approach for solving this problem?\n5. How did we obtain the system of equations?\n6. Can you explain the process of solving for $t,$ $u$, and $a,$ given the system of equations?\n7. What is the significance of obtaining values for $t,$ $u,$ and $a$?\n8. Can you explain why the two lines are skew when $a \\neq 3$? \n9. How can we check that $a = 3$ does not satisfy the condition for skew lines?\n10. Can you think of any other scenarios in which we might need to identify whether two lines are skew?"
