    "solution": "For $x = \\frac{t + 1}{t}$ and $y = \\frac{t - 1}{t},$\n\\[x + y = \\frac{t + 1}{t} + \\frac{t - 1}{t} = \\frac{2t}{t} = 2.\\]Thus, all the plotted points lie on a line.  The answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(A)}}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the equation of the plotted point? What does it look like? \n2. What is the relationship between $t$ and the coordinates of the plotted point? \n3. Can you find any patterns or connections between different values of $t$ and the coordinates of the plotted point? \n4. If we vary $t$, how does the plotted point move? \n5. Can you determine the slope of the line that all the plotted points lie on? \n6. Is there any other way to show that all the plotted points lie on a line? \n7. How can we use this result to gain insight about other functions or equations? \n8. What other questions or insights does this problem spark in you?"
