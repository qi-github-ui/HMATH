    "problem": "In three-dimensional space, find the number of lattice points that have a distance of 3 from the origin.\n\nNote: A point is a lattice point if all its coordinates are integers.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "Let the point be $(x,y,z).$  Each coordinate can only be 0, $\\pm 1,$ $\\pm 2,$ or $\\pm 3.$  Checking we find that up to sign, the only possible combinations of $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ that work are either two 0s and one 3, or one 1 and two 2s.\n\nIf there are two 0s and one 3, then there are 3 ways to place the 3.  Then the 3 can be positive or negative, which gives us $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$ points.\n\nIf there is one 1 and two 2s, then there are 3 ways to place the 1.  Then each coordinate can be positive or negative, which gives us $3 \\cdot 2^3 = 24$ points.\n\nTherefore, there are $6 + 24 = \\boxed{30}$ such lattice points.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a lattice point is?\n2. How would you approach finding the number of lattice points that are a distance of 3 from the origin in three-dimensional space?\n3. What are the possible values that each coordinate of the point can take?\n4. How can we determine the valid combinations of coordinates that satisfy the distance condition?\n5. If there are two 0s and one 3, how many ways can we arrange them? Can you explain why?\n6. What about if there is one 1 and two 2s? How many ways can we arrange them? Can you explain why?\n7. How many lattice points do we have in total if we consider both cases?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios or problems where similar reasoning and steps might be useful?"
