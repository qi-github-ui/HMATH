    "solution": "Squaring both sides, we get\n\\[\\sin^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2n} \\right) + 2 \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2n} \\right) \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2n} \\right) + \\cos^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2n} \\right) = \\frac{n}{4},\\]which we can re-write as\n\\[\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{n} + 1 = \\frac{n}{4},\\]so\n\\[\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{n} = \\frac{n}{4} - 1.\\]Since $-1 \\le \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{n} \\le 1,$ we must also have $-1 \\le \\frac{n}{4} - 1 \\le 1,$ which is equivalent to $0 \\le n \\le 8.$\n\nThe integer $n$ cannot be 0, so $1 \\le n \\le 8,$ which means $\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{n}$ is positive.  Hence, $5 \\le n \\le 8.$\n\nNote that $n = 6$ works:\n\\[\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{6}{4} - 1.\\]Furthermore, $\\sin \\frac{\\pi}{n}$ is a decreasing function of $n,$ and $\\frac{n}{4} - 1$ is an increasing function of $n,$ so $n = \\boxed{6}$ is the unique solution.",

If so, what methods have you used to solve them?\n3. If we square both sides of the equation, what effect does it have on each term? Can you explain why we might want to do this?\n4. After squaring both sides, what does the equation look like? Can you simplify it further?\n5. What relationships between trigonometric functions can you use to simplify the equation involving sin(pi/n) and cos(pi/n)?\n6. How can the equation be rewritten using the angle addition formula for sine?\n7. Why does the range of possible values for n need to be restricted? In other words, why do we have to consider 1 ≤ n ≤ 8?\n8. How can you use the condition -1 ≤ sin(pi/n) ≤ 1 to determine the valid values of n?\n9. Can you show that n = 6 is a solution to the equation? Why is it unique?\n10. Are there any other values of n within the valid range that satisfy the equation? Can you explain why not?"
