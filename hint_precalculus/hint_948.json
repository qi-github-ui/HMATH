    "solution": "We can write the system as\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & k & 3 \\\\ 3 & k & -2 \\\\ 2 & 4 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]This system has a nontrivial system exactly when the determinant of the matrix is 0.  This determinant is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\begin{vmatrix} 1 & k & 3 \\\\ 3 & k & -2 \\\\ 2 & 4 & -3 \\end{vmatrix} &= \\begin{vmatrix} k & -2 \\\\ 4 & -3 \\end{vmatrix} - k \\begin{vmatrix} 3 & -2 \\\\ 2 & -3 \\end{vmatrix} + 3 \\begin{vmatrix} 3 & k \\\\ 2 & 4 \\end{vmatrix} \\\\\n&= ((k)(-3) - (-2)(4)) - k((3)(-3) - (-2)(2)) + 3((3)(4) - (k)(2)) \\\\\n&= 44 - 4k.\n\\end{align*}Hence, $k = 11.$\n\nThe system becomes\n\\begin{align*}\nx + 11y + 3z &= 0, \\\\\n3x + 11y - 2z &= 0, \\\\\n2x + 4y - 3z &= 0\n\\end{align*}Subtracting the first two equations, we get $2x - 5z = 0,$ so $z = \\frac{2}{5} x.$  Substituting into the third equation, we get\n\\[2x + 4y - \\frac{6}{5} x = 0.\\]This simplifies to $y = -\\frac{1}{5} x.$  Therefore,\n\\[\\frac{xz}{y^2} = \\frac{x \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} x}{\\left( -\\frac{1}{5} x \\right)^2} = \\boxed{10}.\\]",
