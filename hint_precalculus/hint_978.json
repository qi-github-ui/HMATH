    "solution": "We can express the vector as\n\\[\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} + s \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Thus, the plane is generated by $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix},$ so we can find the normal vector of the plane by taking their cross product:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Scaling, we can take $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector.  Thus, the equation of the plane is of the form\n\\[2x + z + D = 0.\\]Substituting the coordinates of $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix},$ we find that the equation of the plane is\n\\[\\boxed{2x + z - 5 = 0}.\\]",
