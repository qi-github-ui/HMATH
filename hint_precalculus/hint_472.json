What is the significance of the determinant $\\begin{vmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{vmatrix}$ being equal to 5 in relation to the given matrix?\n3. How does the determinant change when we subtract $c$ from $a$ and $d$ from $b$ in the given matrix?\n4. Can you explain why the equation $(a - c)d - (b - d)c$ is equal to the determinant of the given matrix?\n5. What is the geometric interpretation of the determinant of a matrix?\n6. In general, what properties or transformations affect the determinant of a matrix?\n7. Can you think of any other examples where a similar thought process and steps can be used to determine the determinant of a matrix?"
