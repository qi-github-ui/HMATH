    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the initial condition $a_0 = \\sin^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{45} \\right)$ and the recursive equation $a_{n + 1} = 4a_n (1 - a_n)$ in your own words?\n2. How can we find the next term $a_{n + 1}$ given the current term $a_n$ using the equation $a_{n + 1} = 4a_n (1 - a_n)$?\n3. Based on the recursive equation, what can we say about the relationship between $a_0$ and $a_1$?\n4. Can you find any patterns or similarities between $a_0, a_1, a_2, \\dots$ as you calculate more terms?\n5. How can we express $a_n$ in terms of $a_0$ and $n$ using the pattern you observed?\n6. What are we trying to find in this problem and how can we rephrase the problem in terms of $a_n$ and $a_0$?\n7. How can we use the equation $\\sin^2 \\left( \\frac{2^n \\pi}{45} \\right) = \\sin^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{45} \\right)$ to solve for the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $a_n = a_0$?\n8. What does it mean for two angles to add up to a multiple of $\\pi$ or differ by a multiple of $\\pi$?\n9. Can you explain the reasoning behind the statement $2^n \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod{45}$?\n10. How can we use this congruence relation to find the smallest $n$ that satisfies the equation $\\sin^2 \\left( \\frac{2^n \\pi}{45} \\right) = \\sin^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{45} \\right)$?"
