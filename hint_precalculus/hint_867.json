    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of the dot product between two vectors?\n2. How does the dot product relate to the projection of a vector onto another?\n3. Can you explain the formula for finding the projection of vector v onto vector w?\n4. In this case, what values do we know already for v and w, and what do we need to find?\n5. How can we apply the formula for projection to find the magnitude of projw v?\n6. What is the significance of the magnitude of the projection in this context?\n7. Are there any alternative methods we could use to find the magnitude of the projection?\n8. How do the properties of the dot product and vector magnitudes help in solving this problem?\n9. Can you think of any other scenarios where understanding the projection of vectors is important?\n10. How does finding the magnitude of the projection lead to a better understanding of vector operations?"
