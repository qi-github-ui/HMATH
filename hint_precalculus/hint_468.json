Based on the special values of the sine function, what do you think is the value of $\\arcsin 1$?\n5. Can you express this value in radians?\n6. Is it possible for $\\arcsin 1$ to have multiple values? If so, what are they?\n7. Considering the range of $\\arcsin$ and the given input value of $1$, can you conclude that $\\arcsin 1$ has a unique value?\n8. What does the value of $\\arcsin 1$ tell us about an angle in the unit circle?\n9. Can you visualize the angle corresponding to $\\arcsin 1$ in the unit circle?\n10. How does the value of $\\arcsin 1$ relate to the concept of an inverse function?"
