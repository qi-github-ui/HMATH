    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "From the equation $a^3 b^5 = 1,$ $a^6 b^{10} = 1.$  From the equation $a^7 b^2 = 1,$ $a^{35} b^{10} = 1.$  Dividing these equations, we get\n\\[a^{29} = 1.\\]Therefore, $a$ must be a 29th root of unity.\n\nFrom the equation $a^7 b^2 = 1,$ $a^{14} b^4 = 1.$  Hence,\n\\[\\frac{a^3 b^5}{a^{14} b^4} = 1.\\]This leads to $b = a^{11}.$\n\nConversely, if $a$ is a 29th root of unity, and $b = a^{11},$ then\n\\begin{align*}\na^3 b^5 &= a^3 (a^{11})^5 = a^{58} = 1, \\\\\na^7 b^2 &= a^7 (a^{11})^2 = a^{29} = 1.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the solutions $(a,b)$ are of the form $(\\omega, \\omega^{11}),$ where $\\omega$ is a 29th root of unity, giving us $\\boxed{29}$ solutions.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this equation? \n2. What does it mean for both $a^3 b^5$ and $a^7 b^2$ to equal 1? \n3. How can we use the first equation to obtain a relationship between $a$ and $b$? \n4. What does it mean for $a^{29}$ to equal 1? \n5. How can we use the second equation to obtain a relationship between $a$ and $b$? \n6. Can you explain why the solutions $(a,b)$ are of the form $(\\omega, \\omega^{11})$, where $\\omega$ is a 29th root of unity? \n7. How can we find the number of 29th roots of unity? \n8. How many solutions are there for $(a,b)$?"
