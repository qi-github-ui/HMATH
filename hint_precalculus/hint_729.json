    "solution": "The line passes through $\\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix},$ so its direction vector is proportional to\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]To get a $y$-coordinate of $-1,$ we can multiply this vector by the scalar $\\frac{1}{5}.$  This gives us\n\\[\\frac{1}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3/5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Therefore, $a = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}.$",
