    "solution": "Squaring the given equation, we get\n\\[e^{2 i \\theta} = \\left( \\frac{2 + i \\sqrt{5}}{3} \\right)^2 = \\frac{-1 + 4i \\sqrt{5}}{9}.\\]Squaring again, we get\n\\[e^{4 i \\theta} = \\left( \\frac{-1 + 4i \\sqrt{5}}{9} \\right)^2 = \\frac{-79 - 8i \\sqrt{5}}{81}.\\]Therefore, $\\sin 4 \\theta = \\boxed{-\\frac{8 \\sqrt{5}}{81}}.$",
