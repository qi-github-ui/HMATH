What is meant by the period of a trigonometric function?\n4. How do we convert radians to degrees?\n5. What is the angle measure in degrees of $\\frac{9\\pi}{4}$?\n6. How can we use the periodicity of the tangent function to find the value of $\\tan\\frac{9\\pi}{4}$?\n7. Can you explain why $\\tan 405^\\circ = \\tan (405^\\circ - 360^\\circ) = \\tan 45^\\circ$?\n8. Are there other angles with the same tangent value as $\\frac{9\\pi}{4}$? If so, can you give an example?"
