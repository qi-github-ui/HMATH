    "solution": "The plane $-2x + y - 3z = 7$ has normal vector $\\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix},$ so the plane we seek will also have this normal vector.  In other words, the plane will have an equation of the form\n\\[-2x + y - 3z + D = 0.\\]Since we want the coefficient of $x$ to be positive, we can multiply by $-1$ to get\n\\[2x - y + 3z - D = 0.\\]Setting $x = 1,$ $y = 4,$ and $z = -2,$ we get $-8 - D = 0,$ so $D = -8.$  Thus, the equation we seek is\n\\[\\boxed{2x - y + 3z + 8 = 0}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the normal vector of the plane passing through the point $(1,4,-2)$?\n2. How can we use the fact that the plane we seek is parallel to the plane $-2x + y - 3z = 7$?\n3. Why do we want the coefficient of $x$ to be positive in the equation we seek?\n4. What constraints do we have on the integers $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ and $D$ in the equation we seek?\n5. How did we determine the value of $D$ in the equation we seek?\n6. Can you think of a scenario where we might need to find an equation of a plane given a point and a parallel plane?"
