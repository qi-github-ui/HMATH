How does the graph of $y = \\sin x$ relate to the line $y = \\frac{x}{100}$?\n3. At what value of $x$ is the last crest of the sine function that intersects the line $y = \\frac{x}{100}$?\n4. Why do we only consider the values of $x$ up to $100$ in this equation?\n5. How many times do the graphs of $y = \\frac{x}{100}$ and $y = \\sin x$ intersect on the interval $[0, 2 \\pi]$?\n6. Are there any solutions to the equation $\\frac{x}{100} = \\sin x$ outside the interval $[-100, 100]$?\n7.
