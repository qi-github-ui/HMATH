    "solution": "In general, the area of the parallelogram generated by two vectors $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ is\n\\[\\|\\mathbf{v}\\| \\|\\mathbf{w}\\| \\sin \\theta,\\]where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}.$  This is precisely the magnitude of $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{w}.$\n\nThus, the area of the parallelogram is\n\\[\\left\\| \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\| = \\left\\| \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ -14 \\\\ -10 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\| = \\boxed{10 \\sqrt{3}}.\\]",
