    "solution": "Since $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ is its own inverse,\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{I}.\\]This gives us\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 9 - c & -d - 3 \\\\ cd + 3c & d^2 - c \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{I}.\\]Then $9 - c = 1,$ $-d - 3 = 0,$ $cd + 3c = 0,$ and $d^2 - c = 1.$  Solving, we find $(c,d) = \\boxed{(8,-3)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem? What does it mean for a matrix to be its own inverse?\n2. What does it mean for two matrices to be equal? How does this help us in finding the values of $c$ and $d$?\n3. How do we multiply two matrices? Can you perform the multiplication $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ and simplify the equation?\n4. What are the different elements in the resulting matrix after simplification? How can we equate this matrix to the identity matrix $\\mathbf{I}$?\n5. By comparing the elements, what values can we determine for $c$ and $d$? How do these values satisfy the equation $\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -1 \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{I}$?\n6. Can you think of any other situations where a matrix could be its own inverse? How would you approach solving similar problems with matrices being their own inverses?"
