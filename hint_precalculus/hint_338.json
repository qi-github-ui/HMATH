    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "The transformation that reflects over the $x$-axis takes $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix},$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ to $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix},$ so the matrix is\n\\[\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what reflecting over the $x$-axis means? \n2. How do you think we can find the matrix that corresponds to reflecting over the $x$-axis? \n3. Are there any other matrices that can also achieve a similar reflection? \n4. How do we know that the matrix we found actually reflects over the $x$-axis? \n5. Can you think of any other transformations where we can find their corresponding matrices using a similar approach?"
