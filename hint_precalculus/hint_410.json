    "solution": "The direction vector of the first line is $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.$  The direction vector of the second line is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3/2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}.$\n\nThe lines are orthogonal when the direction vectors will be orthogonal, which means their dot product will be 0.  This gives us\n\\[(a)(1) + (-2) \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right) + (1)(2) = 0.\\]Solving, we find $a = \\boxed{1}.$",
