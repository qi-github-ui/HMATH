    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "Since the tangent function has period $180^\\circ,$\n\\[\\tan (312^\\circ - 2 \\cdot 180^\\circ) = \\tan (-48^\\circ),\\]so $n = \\boxed{-48}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you describe the steps to find an integer value of $n$ for which $\\tan n^\\circ = \\tan 312^\\circ$?\n2. What is the period of the tangent function? How does this period affect the possible values of $n$?\n3. Can you determine any other angles that have the same tangent value as $312^\\circ$? How might this fact help you find the value of $n$?\n4. What is the relationship between $312^\\circ$ and $-48^\\circ$? How does this relationship relate to the solution for $n$?\n5. Are there any restrictions or conditions on the possible values of $n$? How do these restrictions help you determine the correct value for $n$ in this case?\n6. Can you think of any other trigonometric equations where a similar approach or line of thinking might be useful in finding the solution?"
