    "problem": "The set of points $(x,y,z)$ that are equidistant to $(1,2,-5)$ and point $P$ satisfy an equation of the form\n\\[10x - 4y + 24z = 55.\\]Find the point $P.$",

    "solution": "Let $P = (a,b,c).$  If the point $(x,y,z)$ is equidistant to $(1,2,-5)$ and $(a,b,c),$ then\n\\[(x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + (z + 5)^2 = (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2.\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 - 4y + 4 + z^2 + 10z + 25 = x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 + z^2 - 2cz + c^2,\\]which simplifies to\n\\[(2a - 2) x + (2b - 4) y + (2c + 10) z = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 30.\\]We want this to coincide with the equation\n\\[10x - 4y + 24z = 55.\\]If we set $2a - 2 = 10,$ $2b - 4 = -4,$ and $2c + 10 = 24,$ then $a = 6,$ $b = 0,$ and $c = 7.$  Note that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 30 = 55,$ so these values work.  Thus, $(a,b,c) = \\boxed{(6,0,7)}.$",

What does it mean for a point to be equidistant to two other points?\n3. How can we represent the distance between two points algebraically?\n4. What does it mean for two distances to be equal?\n5. How did we use the equation for equidistant points to derive the equation $10x - 4y + 24z = 55$?\n6. How did we use the two equations to solve for the coordinates of point $P$?\n7. What other types of problems involve finding a point equidistant to two other points?"
