    "solution": "The direction vector the line is $\\begin{pmatrix} 5 - 3 \\\\ 1 - 4 \\\\ 6 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix},$ so the line is paramaterized by\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 + 2t \\\\ 4 - 3t \\\\ 1 + 5t \\end{pmatrix}.\\]We want the $z$-coordinate to be 0, so $1 + 5t = 0.$  Then $t = -\\frac{1}{5},$ so the point of intersection is $\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{13}{5}, \\frac{23}{5}, 0 \\right)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the equation of the line passing through the points (3,4,1) and (5,1,6)?\n2. How would you find the direction vector of the line passing through these two points?\n3. Could you explain the process of parameterizing a line using a direction vector and a point on the line?\n4. What does it mean for a point to intersect the xy-plane?\n5. How would you find the value of t that corresponds to the point of intersection of the line and the xy-plane?\n6. What are the coordinates of the point where the line passing through the two given points intersects the xy-plane?"
