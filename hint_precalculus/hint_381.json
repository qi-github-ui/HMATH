    "solution": "The side length of equilateral triangle $ABC$ is 3.\n\nLet $x = BP.$  Then $AP = A'P = 3 - x,$ so by the Law of Cosines on triangle $PBA',$\n\\[(3 - x)^2 = x^2 + 3^2 - 2 \\cdot x \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\cos 60^\\circ = x^2 - 3x + 9.\\]Solving, we find $x = \\frac{8}{5}.$\n\nLet $y = CQ.$  Then $AQ = A'Q = 3 - y,$ so by the Law of Cosines on triangle $QCA',$\n\\[(3 - y)^2 = y^2 + 2^2 - 2 \\cdot y \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\cos 60^\\circ = y^2 - 2y + 4.\\]Solving, we find $y = \\frac{5}{4}.$\n\nThen $AP = \\frac{7}{5}$ and $AQ = \\frac{7}{4},$ so by the Law of Cosines on triangle $APQ,$\n\\[PQ^2 = \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^2  - \\frac{7}{5} \\cdot \\frac{7}{4} + \\left( \\frac{7}{4} \\right)^2} = \\boxed{\\frac{7 \\sqrt{21}}{20}}.\\]",
