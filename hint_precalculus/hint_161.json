    "solution": "The entries in each row are $\\cos n,$ $\\cos (n + 1),$ and $\\cos (n + 2)$ for some integer $n.$  From the angle addition formula,\n\\[\\cos n + \\cos (n + 2) = 2 \\cos (n + 1) \\cos 1.\\]Then\n\\[\\cos (n + 2) = 2 \\cos 1 \\cos (n + 1) - \\cos n.\\]Thus, we can obtain the third column of the matrix by multiplying the second column by $2 \\cos 1,$ and subtracting the first column.  In other words, the third column is a linear combination of the first two columns.  Therefore, the determinant is $\\boxed{0}.$",
