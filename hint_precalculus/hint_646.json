    "solution": "For the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$ to be orthogonal, their dot product should be 0:\n\\[(2)(x) + (5)(-3) = 0.\\]Solving, we find $x = \\boxed{\\frac{15}{2}}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of orthogonal vectors?\n2. How do we determine if two vectors are orthogonal to each other?\n3. What is the dot product of two vectors and how is it calculated?\n4. How do we use the dot product to determine if two vectors are orthogonal?\n5. What is the dot product of the vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}$?\n6. How do we solve for $x$ if we know that the dot product of the two vectors is 0?\n7. Can you think of any other applications of orthogonal vectors in mathematics or physics?"
