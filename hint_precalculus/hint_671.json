    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "We have that $r = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-2)^2} = 2 \\sqrt{2}.$  Also, if we draw the line connecting the origin and $(-2,2),$ this line makes an angle of $\\frac{5 \\pi}{4}$ with the positive $x$-axis.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.8 cm);\n\ndraw((-3.5,0)--(3.5,0));\ndraw((0,-3.5)--(0,3.5));\ndraw(arc((0,0),2*sqrt(2),0,225),red,Arrow(6));\ndraw((0,0)--(-2,-2));\n\ndot((-2,-2), red);\nlabel(\"$(-2,-2)$\", (-2,-2), SE, UnFill);\ndot((2*sqrt(2),0), red);\n[/asy]\n\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are $\\boxed{\\left( 2 \\sqrt{2}, \\frac{5 \\pi}{4} \\right)}.$",
