    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in finding the point in the plane that is closest to the given point?\n2. How can we determine the closest point in a plane to a given point? Are there any specific methods or techniques?\n3. In this problem, what is the relationship between the normal vector of the plane and the vector connecting the given point to the closest point? How can we use this relationship to find the closest point?\n4. How can we express the coordinates of the closest point in terms of a scalar parameter and the given point?\n5. By substituting the coordinates into the equation of the plane, how can we solve for the value of the scalar parameter?\n6. What are the final coordinates of the point in the plane that is closest to the given point?"
