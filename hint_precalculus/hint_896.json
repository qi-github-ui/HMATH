What are the x-intercepts of the graphs $y = \\sin x$ and $y = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^x$?\n4. In what intervals does the graph of $y = \\sin x$ intersect the graph of $y = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^x$?\n5. How can we determine the number of intersections between the two graphs on the interval $(0, 100 \\pi)$?\n6. Can you explain why the two graphs intersect twice on each interval of the form $(2 \\pi n, 2 \\pi n + \\pi)$? \n7. Why do the two graphs not intersect on each interval of the form $(2 \\pi n + \\pi, 2 \\pi n + 2 \\pi)$?\n8. Are there any other intervals on which the two graphs intersect? If so, where are they located?\n9. What is the total number of intersections between the two graphs on the interval $(0, 100 \\pi)$?\n10. Can you think of any other equations or functions that might have similar intersection patterns on a given interval?"
