    "solution": "We can assume that the side length of the square is 2.  Then by Pythagoras, $AM = AN = \\sqrt{5},$ and $MN = \\sqrt{2},$ so by the Law of Cosines on triangle $AMN,$\n\\[\\cos \\theta = \\frac{AM^2 + AN^2 - MN^2}{2 \\cdot AM \\cdot AN} = \\frac{5 + 5 - 2}{10} = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}.\\]Then\n\\[\\sin^2 \\theta = 1 - \\cos^2 \\theta = \\frac{9}{25}.\\]Since $\\theta$ is acute, $\\sin \\theta = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}.$",
