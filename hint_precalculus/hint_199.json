What are the necessary conditions for one vector to be a scalar multiple of another vector?\n3. Based on the given information, is it true that the vector v is a scalar multiple of the vector w? Why or why not?\n4. If v is a scalar multiple of w, what can we say about the projection of v onto w?\n5. How do we compute the projection of a vector onto another vector?\n6. Using the information given, what is the projection of v onto w?\n7. Can you think of any other vectors in which the projection onto w would be the original vector itself? If so, what are they?"
