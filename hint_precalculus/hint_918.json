    "solution": "In cylindrical coordinates, $\\theta$ denotes the angle a point makes with the positive $x$-axis.  Thus, for a fixed angle $\\theta = c,$ all the points lie on a plane.  The answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(C)}}.$  Note that we can obtain all points in this plane by taking $r$ negative.\n\n[asy]\nimport three;\nimport solids;\n\nsize(200);\ncurrentprojection = perspective(6,3,2);\ncurrentlight = (1,0,1);\nreal theta = 150;\n\ndraw((0,0,0)--(-2,0,0));\ndraw((0,0,0)--(0,-2,0));\ndraw(surface((Cos(theta),Sin(theta),1)--(Cos(theta),Sin(theta),-1)--(Cos(theta + 180),Sin(theta + 180),-1)--(Cos(theta + 180),Sin(theta + 180),1)--cycle), gray(0.7),nolight);\ndraw((0,0,0)--(2,0,0));\ndraw((0,0,0)--(0,2,0));\ndraw((0,0,-1.5)--(0,0,1.5));\ndraw((1.5*Cos(theta),1.5*Sin(theta),0)--(1.5*Cos(theta + 180),1.5*Sin(theta + 180),0));\ndraw((0.5,0,0)..(0.5*Cos(theta/2),0.5*Sin(theta/2),0)..(0.5*Cos(theta),0.5*Sin(theta),0),red,Arrow3(6));\ndraw((0,0,0)--(0,-1,0),dashed);\ndraw((0,0,0)--(-2,0,0),dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$\\theta$\", (0.7,0.6,0), white);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (2,0,0), SW);\nlabel(\"$y$\", (0,2,0), E);\nlabel(\"$z$\", (0,0,1.5), N);\nlabel(\"$\\theta = c$\", (Cos(theta),Sin(theta),-1), SE);\n[/asy]",
