    "solution": "The function $f(x) = \\arcsin (\\log_m (nx))$ is defined when\n\\[-1 \\le \\log_m (nx) \\le 1.\\]This is equivalent to\n\\[\\frac{1}{m} \\le nx \\le m,\\]or\n\\[\\frac{1}{mn} \\le x \\le \\frac{m}{n}.\\]Thus, the length of the interval is $\\frac{m}{n} - \\frac{1}{mn} = \\frac{m^2 - 1}{mn},$ giving us the equation\n\\[\\frac{m^2 - 1}{mn} = \\frac{1}{2013}.\\]Hence\n\\[n = \\frac{2013 (m^2 - 1)}{m} = \\frac{2013m^2 - 2013}{m}.\\]We want to minimize $n + m = \\frac{2014m^2 - 2013}{m}.$  It is not hard to prove that this is an increasing function for $m \\ge 1;$ thus, we want to find the smallest possible value of $m.$\n\nBecause $m$ and $m^2 - 1$ are relatively prime, $m$ must divide 2013.  The prime factorization of 2013 is $3 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 61.$  The smallest possible value for $m$ is then 3.  For $m = 3,$\n\\[n = \\frac{2013 (3^2 - 1)}{3} = 5368,\\]and the smallest possible value of $m + n$ is $\\boxed{5371}.$",
