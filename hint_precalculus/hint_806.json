    "problem": "For how many integers $n$ with $1 \\le n \\le 2012$ is the product\n\\[\n  \\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \\left( \\left( 1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n} \\right)^n + 1 \\right) \n\\]equal to zero?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "If the product is $0$, then one of the factors $(1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n})^n + 1$ is $0$.  This means that\n\\[(1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n})^n = -1,\\]which tells us that $  1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n} $ has magnitude $1$, meaning it is on the unit circle. If we translate it to the left by subtracting $1$, we get $e^{2 \\pi i k / n} $ which will also be on the unit circle, and hence have magnitude $1$.\n\nWe can visualize this as the three complex numbers $-1$, $0$, and $e^{2 \\pi i k / n}$ forming the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length $1$. So $e^{2 \\pi i k / n}$ is either $e^{2 \\pi i / 3}$ or its conjugate. This means that $  1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n} $ is either $ e^{ \\pi i / 3} $ or its conjugate, which tells us that $( 1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n})^n$ is either $ e^{ n \\pi i / 3} $ or its conjugate. The only way this can be $-1$ is if $n$ is an odd multiple of $3$, and in this case, the factor corresponding to $k=n/3$ will be zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes counting the odd multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $2012$. Since $2010 = 3\\cdot 670$ there are $670$ multiples of $3$ in this interval, half of which must be odd. Our answer is $\\boxed{335}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean for the product to be equal to zero in this context?\n2. What does the term $(1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n})^n$ represent geometrically?\n3. How does the fact that $e^{2 \\pi i k / n}$ is on the unit circle relate to the product being zero?\n4. How can we determine which values of $k$ lead to the product being zero?\n5. What can we say about $(1 + e^{2 \\pi i k / n})^n$ if it equals $-1$?\n6. What is the connection between the odd multiples of 3 and the factors of the product being zero?\n7. Can you explain step by step how we arrived at the result of counting odd multiples of 3 between 1 and 2012?\n8. Are there any other values of $n$ for which the product could be equal to zero?"
