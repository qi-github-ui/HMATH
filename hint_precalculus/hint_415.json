    "problem": "Convert the point $(2 \\sqrt{3}, 6, -4)$ in rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(\\rho,\\theta,\\phi),$ where $\\rho > 0,$ $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi,$ and $0 \\le \\phi \\le \\pi.$",

    "solution": "We have that $\\rho = \\sqrt{(2 \\sqrt{3})^2 + 6^2 + (-4)^2} = 8.$  We want $\\phi$ to satisfy\n\\[-4 = 8 \\cos \\phi,\\]so $\\phi = \\frac{2 \\pi}{3}.$\n\nWe want $\\theta$ to satisfy\n\\begin{align*}\n2 \\sqrt{3} &= 8 \\sin \\frac{2 \\pi}{3} \\cos \\theta, \\\\\n6 &= 8 \\sin \\frac{2 \\pi}{3} \\sin \\theta.\n\\end{align*}Thus, $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3},$ so the spherical coordinates are $\\boxed{\\left( 8, \\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\frac{2 \\pi}{3} \\right)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in converting the point from rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates?\n2. Are you familiar with the formulas used to convert from rectangular to spherical coordinates?\n3. How did you determine the value of $\\rho$ in the spherical coordinates? What formula did you use?\n4. What condition does $\\phi$ need to satisfy in order to convert the point to spherical coordinates? How did you use this condition to find the value of $\\phi$?\n5. Can you explain how you found the value of $\\theta$ in the spherical coordinates? What formulas did you use and how did you manipulate them to find the value?\n6. Are there any other types of coordinate conversions where similar thinking and steps might be applied? Can you provide an example?"
