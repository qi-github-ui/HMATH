    "solution": "Consider a right triangle where the adjacent side is 4 and the opposite side is 7.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize (0.5 cm);\n\ndraw((0,0)--(4,0)--(4,7)--cycle);\n\nlabel(\"$4$\", (2,0), S);\nlabel(\"$7$\", (4,7/2), E);\nlabel(\"$\\theta$\", (0.8,0.5));\n[/asy]\n\nThen $\\cot \\theta = \\frac{4}{7},$ so $\\theta = \\operatorname{arccot} \\frac{4}{7}.$  Hence, $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\cot \\theta} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{4}}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define the trigonometric function $\\cot \\theta$ in terms of the sides of a right triangle?\n2. Given that $\\cot \\theta = \\frac{4}{7}$ in this particular triangle, what does that tell us about the relationship between the lengths of the adjacent and opposite sides?\n3. Can you determine the value of the angle $\\theta$ using the given information? How would you do that?\n4. If $\\theta = \\operatorname{arccot} \\frac{4}{7}$, what does that imply about the values of $\\cot \\theta$ and $\\theta$?\n5. How would you define the trigonometric function $\\tan \\theta$ in terms of the sides of a right triangle?\n6. Using the values of $\\cot \\theta$ and $\\theta$ that we found earlier, what is the value of $\\tan \\theta$ in this case?\n7. Can you express your answer for $\\tan \\theta$ in a simplified form?"
