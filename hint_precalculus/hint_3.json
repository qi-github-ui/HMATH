    "problem": "Let $S$ be a region in the plane with area 10.  When we apply the matrix\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 7 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\]to $S,$ we obtain the region $S'.$  Find the area of $S'.$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "Note that\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 7 & -3 \\end{vmatrix} = (2)(-3) - (1)(7) = -13,\\]so the matrix scales the area of any region by a factor of $|-13| = 13.$  In particular, the area of $S'$ is $13 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{130}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what applying the matrix to a region means in terms of transformations?\n2. How does the determinant of the matrix relate to the scaling factor of the area of the region?\n3. How can you use the given matrix to find the area of the region $S'$?\n4. Can you explain why the determinant being negative implies that the region is reflected or flipped?\n5. Are there any other properties or characteristics of the given matrix that could affect the resulting area of the region?\n6. Can you think of any other examples or scenarios where applying a matrix transformation would impact the area of a region? How would you approach finding the new area in those cases?"
