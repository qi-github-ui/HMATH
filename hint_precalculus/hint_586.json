    "problem": "Convert the point $( -2, -2 \\sqrt{3}, -1)$ in rectangular coordinates to cylindrical coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta,z),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "We have that $r = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-2 \\sqrt{3})^2} = 4.$  We want $\\theta$ to satisfy\n\\begin{align*}\n-2 &= 4 \\cos \\theta, \\\\\n-2 \\sqrt{3} &= 4 \\sin \\theta.\n\\end{align*}Thus, $\\theta = \\frac{4 \\pi}{3},$ so the cylindrical coordinates are $\\boxed{\\left( 4, \\frac{4 \\pi}{3}, -1 \\right)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How do we convert a point from rectangular coordinates to cylindrical coordinates?\n2. What are the equations that relate the rectangular and cylindrical coordinates? Can you write them down?\n3. Do you notice any patterns or relationships between the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ in rectangular coordinates and the values of $r$, $\\theta$, and $z$ in cylindrical coordinates?\n4. How can we find the value of $r$ in cylindrical coordinates for this given point?\n5. How can we find the value of $\\theta$ in cylindrical coordinates for this given point?\n6. Can we use trigonometric functions to find the value of $\\theta$? If so, which trigonometric functions?\n7.
