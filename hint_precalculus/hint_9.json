    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the concept of DeMoivre's Theorem and how is it used in this problem?\n2. Can you explain why we are raising the expression $(\\cos 185^\\circ + i \\sin 185^\\circ)$ to the power of 54?\n3. What is the significance of the angle 9990 degrees in the solution?\n4. How did we simplify the expression $\\cos 9990^\\circ + i \\sin 9990^\\circ$ to $\\cos 270^\\circ + i \\sin 270^\\circ$?\n5. What is the final result of the expression $(\\cos 185^\\circ + i \\sin 185^\\circ)^{54}$?\n6. Can you think of any other examples or scenarios where DeMoivre's Theorem can be applied?\n7. How would you explain the concept of complex numbers and their representation in trigonometric form to someone who is new to the topic?"
