    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given equation and what is the desired quantity to find?\n2. Can you rewrite $\\tan x$ in terms of the opposite and adjacent sides of a right triangle?\n3. What side lengths can we associate with $2ab$ and $a^2 - b^2$ in the context of a right triangle?\n4. How can we use the Pythagorean theorem to relate $a^2 + b^2$ to the side lengths of this right triangle?\n5. Can you write an expression for $\\sin x$ in terms of the side lengths above?\n6. How does the requirement that $a > b > 0$ and $0^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ$ constrain the possible values of the sides of the right triangle, and what implications does this have for our answer?"
