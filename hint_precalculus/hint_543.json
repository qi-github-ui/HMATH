    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the equation given and its significance in terms of distance from the origin?\n2. What geometric shape has the property that every point on its graph has a fixed distance from a given point (in this case, the origin)?\n3. Based on the information given, which shape(s) listed as options could potentially satisfy this property?\n4. What are the defining characteristics of a circle?\n5. How does the given equation match the characteristics of a circle?\n6. What are the other options listed? Can any of those options satisfy the given property?\n7. Can you think of any other equations that could potentially represent a circle-like shape? How would you analyze those equations to determine if they indeed represent a circle?"
