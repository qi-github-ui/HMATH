    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "From the triple angle formulas, $\\cos 3 \\theta = 4 \\cos^3 \\theta - 3 \\cos \\theta.$  Hence,\n\\[\\cos^3 \\theta = \\frac{1}{4} \\cos 3 \\theta + \\frac{3}{4} \\cos \\theta,\\]so $(a,b) = \\boxed{\\left( \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4} \\right)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given equation and what are we trying to find? \n2. How can we use the triple angle formulas to simplify the equation?\n3.
