    "socratic_questions": "1. Could you explain what a vector is and how it is represented in the given problem?\n2. How would you define a parallelogram? What are its properties?\n3. Can you describe the relationship between the area of a parallelogram and the area of a triangle with the same base and height?\n4. How can we find the area of a parallelogram using vectors?\n5. What does it mean for two vectors to be multiplied together? How does this relate to finding the area of a parallelogram?\n6. Can you explain why the area of the parallelogram formed by $\\mathbf{0},$ $\\mathbf{a},$ $\\mathbf{b},$ and $\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}$ is equal to $|(3)(2) - (-5)(1)| = 11$?\n7. Why do we divide the area of the parallelogram by 2 to find the area of the triangle?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios or problems where vectors and areas can be connected in a similar way?"
