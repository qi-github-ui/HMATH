    "solution": "Solution 1: Let $u = -2 + 3i$ and $v = 1 + i$, and let $z$ lie on the line joining $u$ and $v.$  Then\n\\[\\frac{z - u}{v - u}\\]is real.  But a complex number is real if and only if it is equal to its conjugate, which gives us the equation\n\\[\\frac{z - u}{v - u} = \\frac{\\overline{z} - \\overline{u}}{\\overline{v} - \\overline{u}}.\\]Substituting $u = -2 + 3i$ and $v = 1 + i$, we get\n\\[\\frac{z + 2 - 3i}{3 - 2i} = \\frac{\\overline{z} + 2 + 3i}{3 + 2i}.\\]Cross-multiplying, we get\n\\[(3 + 2i)(z + 2 - 3i) = (3 - 2i)(\\overline{z} + 2 + 3i).\\]This simplifies to\n\\[(3 + 2i) z + (-3 + 2i) = 10i.\\]Multiplying both sides by $-i$, we get\n\\[(2 - 3i) z + (2 + 3i) \\overline{z} = 10.\\]Hence, $a = 2 - 3i$ and $b = 2 + 3i$, so $ab = (2 - 3i)(2 + 3i) = \\boxed{13}$.\n\nSolution 2: Substituting $z = -2 + 3i$ and $z = 1 + i$ in the given equation, we obtain the system of equations\n\\begin{align*}\n(-2 + 3i) a + (-2 - 3i) b &= 10, \\\\\n(1 + i) a + (1 - i) b &= 10.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting these equations, we get\n\\[(3 - 2i) a + (3 + 2i) b = 0,\\]so\n\\[b = -\\frac{3 - 2i}{3 + 2i} a.\\]Substituting into the first equation, we get\n\\[(-2 + 3i) a - (-2 - 3i) \\cdot \\frac{3 - 2i}{3 + 2i} a = 10.\\]Solving for $a$, we find $a = 2 - 3i.$  Then $b = 2 + 3i$, so $ab = (2 - 3i)(2 + 3i) = \\boxed{13}$.",

Can you explain the reasoning behind the equation $\\frac{z - u}{v - u} = \\frac{\\overline{z} - \\overline{u}}{\\overline{v} - \\overline{u}}$?\n5.

What relationship between $a$ and $b$ do we observe in the equation $(2 - 3i) z + (2 + 3i) \\overline{z} = 10$?\n7. Why did we substitute $z = -2 + 3i$ and $z = 1 + i$ into the equation to obtain the system of equations?\n8. How did we simplify the system of equations to find the value of $b$ in terms of $a$?\n9.
