    "solution": "The direction vectors of the lines are $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -k \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} k \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.$  Suppose these vectors are proportional.  Then comparing $y$-coordinates, we can get the second vector by multiplying the first vector by 2.  But then $2 = k$ and $-2k = 1,$ which is not possible.\n\nSo the vectors cannot be proportional, which means that the lines cannot be parallel.  Therefore, the only way that the lines can be coplanar is if they intersect.\n\nEquating the representations for both lines, and comparing entries, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n2 + t &= 1 + ku, \\\\\n3 + t &= 4 + 2u, \\\\\n4 - kt &= 5 + u.\n\\end{align*}Then $t = 2u + 1.$  Substituting into the first equation, we get $2u + 3 = 1 + ku,$ so $ku = 2u + 2.$\n\nSubstituting into the second equation, we get $4 - k(2u + 1) = 5 + u,$ so $2ku = -k - u - 1.$  Hence, $4u + 4 = -k - u - 1,$ so $k = -5u - 5.$  Then\n\\[(-5u - 5)u = 2u + 2,\\]which simplifies to $5u^2 + 7u + 2 = 0.$  This factors as $(u + 1)(5u + 2) = 0,$ so $u = -1$ or $u = -\\frac{2}{5}.$  This leads to the possible values $\\boxed{0,-3}$ for $k.$",
