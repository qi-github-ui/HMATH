    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we represent the equation $r = \\cos \\theta$ in rectangular coordinates $(x, y)$?\n2. What is the relationship between $\\theta$ and $r$ in the equation $r = \\cos \\theta$?\n3. Why do we need to find the next angle where $r = 1$ or $r = -1$ in order to plot the entire circle?\n4. Can you explain why the values of $\\theta$ in the form $2 \\pi k$ work for $r = 1$? \n5. Can you explain why the values of $\\theta$ in the form $2 \\pi k + \\pi$ work for $r = -1$? \n6. How do the graphs of $r = \\cos \\theta$ and $r = -\\cos \\theta$ relate to each other?\n7. Why does the graph repeat after an interval of $\\pi$?\n8. What is the smallest value of $\\theta$ that allows us to plot the entire circle in polar coordinates?"
