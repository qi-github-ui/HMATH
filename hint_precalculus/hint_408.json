    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the equation of the sphere and what is given in the problem?\n2. What does it mean for a sphere to intersect a plane, and how does this relate to the circles mentioned?\n3. How can we determine the center of the sphere given that it intersects two different planes at two different circles?\n4. What is the relationship between the radius of the sphere and the radii of the two circles of intersection?\n5. If we choose a point on one of the circles, what kind of triangle is formed with the center of the sphere and a point of intersection with the other circle, and how can we use this to find the radius of the sphere?\n6. Can we generalize this problem to intersecting a sphere with other planes or finding other properties of spheres?"
