    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the determinant of a matrix and how is it calculated?\n2. How can we expand the given determinant using the properties of determinants?\n3. Can you explain the steps involved in expanding the determinant and show the intermediate calculations?\n4. Why does the determinant of the matrix equal zero in this case?\n5. How can we factorize the expanded determinant expression and what does each factor represent?\n6. What does it mean for the determinant to be zero? How does that relate to the variables x and y?\n7. How do we determine the values of x and y from the factors of the expanded determinant?\n8. Why do we conclude that x + y = 39?\n9. Can you think of any other matrices or determinant problems where similar reasoning and steps might be applied?"
