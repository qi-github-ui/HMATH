    "problem": "Convert the point $(0, -3 \\sqrt{3}, 3)$ in rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(\\rho,\\theta,\\phi),$ where $\\rho > 0,$ $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi,$ and $0 \\le \\phi \\le \\pi.$",

    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "We have that $\\rho = \\sqrt{0^2 + (-3 \\sqrt{3})^2 + 3^2} = 6.$  We want $\\phi$ to satisfy\n\\[3 = 6 \\cos \\phi,\\]so $\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{3}.$\n\nWe want $\\theta$ to satisfy\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= 6 \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\cos \\theta, \\\\\n-3 \\sqrt{3} &= 6 \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\sin \\theta.\n\\end{align*}Thus, $\\theta = \\frac{3 \\pi}{2},$ so the spherical coordinates are $\\boxed{\\left( 6, \\frac{3 \\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\right)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the spherical coordinate system is and how it is different from rectangular coordinates?\n2. How would you describe the process of converting a point from rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates?\n3. What formulas or relationships do you know that can help us convert between these coordinate systems?\n4. What is the significance of the value of $\\rho$ in the spherical coordinate representation of a point?\n5. Can you explain how to determine the value of $\\phi$ in spherical coordinates?\n6. How can we find the value of $\\theta$ in spherical coordinates for this particular point?\n7. Are there any restrictions or limitations on the values that $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ can take in spherical coordinates? If so, what are they?\n8. Can you verify the calculation of $\\rho,$ $\\theta,$ and $\\phi$ for the given point using the equations we discussed?"
