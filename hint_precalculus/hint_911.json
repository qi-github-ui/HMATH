    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "The transformation that rotates about the origin by an angle of $120^\\circ$ counter-clockwise takes $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ to $\\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ \\sqrt{3}/2 \\end{pmatrix},$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ to $\\begin{pmatrix} -\\sqrt{3}/2 \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix},$ so the matrix is\n\\[\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & -\\sqrt{3}/2 \\\\ \\sqrt{3}/2 & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the transformation of rotating about the origin? What happens to the points on the coordinate plane when we rotate them counter-clockwise by an angle of $120^\\circ$?\n2. How does knowing the transformation of specific points, like $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, help us find the matrix representation of the rotation?\n3. If we want to represent the rotation as a matrix, what properties or characteristics should the matrix have? \n4. Based on the given information, can you determine the entries of the matrix that represents the rotation? How can you relate the transformed coordinates to the matrix entries?\n5. How can we verify that the matrix we found actually represents the desired rotation? Is there a way to check if the matrix appropriately maps the given points to their transformed positions?\n6. Can you think of other types of transformations that can be represented by matrices? How might we approach finding the corresponding matrices for those transformations?"
