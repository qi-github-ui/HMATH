    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "We can write the equation of the second plane as $x - 3y + 3z = 1.$  Note that $(1,0,0)$ is a point on this plane.  (Also, note that both plane have the same normal vector, so they are parallel.)\n\nTherefore, from the formula for the distance between a point and a plane, the distance between the two planes is\n\\[\\frac{|1 - 3 \\cdot 0 + 3 \\cdot 0 - 8|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (-3)^2 + 3^2}} = \\boxed{\\frac{7 \\sqrt{19}}{19}}.\\]",
