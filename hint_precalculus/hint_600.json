Can you explain why the determinant of A raised to the power of 3 is the cube of the determinant of A? \n4. If the determinant of A is 5, what value does this give us for the determinant of A^3? \n5. Can you provide an example to illustrate the property of determinants when it comes to raising a matrix to a power? \n6. Are there any other properties or rules related to determinants that could be useful in solving similar problems?"
