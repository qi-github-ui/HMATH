    "problem": "The sides of an isosceles triangle are $\\cos x,$ $\\cos x,$ and $\\cos 7x,$ and its vertex angle is $2x.$  (All angle measurements are in degrees.)  Enter all possible values of $x,$ separated by commas.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "Note that angle $x$ must be acute.\n\nIf we drop an altitude from the vertex of the isosceles triangle, then we obtain two right triangles, where one of the angles is $x,$ the opposite side is $\\frac{\\cos 7x}{2},$ and the hypotenuse is $\\cos x.$  Hence,\n\\[\\sin x = \\frac{\\frac{\\cos 7x}{2}}{\\cos x} = \\frac{\\cos 7x}{2 \\cos x}.\\]Then $\\cos 7x = 2 \\sin x \\cos x = \\sin 2x.$  We can write this as $\\cos 7x = \\cos (90^\\circ - 2x).$  Then the angles $7x$ and $90^\\circ - 2x$ must either add up to a multiple of $180^\\circ,$ or differ by a multiple of $90^\\circ.$\n\nIn the first case,\n\\[7x + 90^\\circ - 2x = 180^\\circ k\\]for some integer $k.$  Then\n\\[x = 36^\\circ k - 18^\\circ.\\]The only acute angles of this form are $18^\\circ$ and $54^\\circ.$  Furthermore, if $x = 18^\\circ,$ then $\\cos 7x = \\cos 126^\\circ < 0.$  We check that $x = 54^\\circ$ works.\n\nIn the second case,\n\\[7x - (90^\\circ - 2x) = 180^\\circ k\\]for some integer $k.$  Then\n\\[x = 20^\\circ k + 10^\\circ.\\]The only acute angles of this form are $10^\\circ,$ $30^\\circ,$ $50^\\circ,$ and $70^\\circ.$  Again, $\\cos 7x < 0$ for $x = 30^\\circ$ and $70^\\circ.$  We check that $10^\\circ$ and $50^\\circ$ work.\n\nThus, the possible values of $x$ are $\\boxed{10^\\circ, 50^\\circ, 54^\\circ}.$",
