    "problem": "In a triangle, two of the side lengths are 7 and 8, and the angle between them is $120^\\circ.$  Find the length of the third side.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "By the Law of Cosines, the third side is\n\\[\\sqrt{7^2 +  8^2 - 2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 8 \\cos 120^\\circ} = \\sqrt{7^2 + 8^2 + 7 \\cdot 8} = \\boxed{13}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the Law of Cosines? \n2. How is the Law of Cosines used to find side lengths in a triangle? \n3.
