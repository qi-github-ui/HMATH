    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find? Can you restate it in your own words?\n2. How would you approach this problem? Can you break it down into smaller steps?\n3. Let's start by considering the matrix multiplication between $\\mathbf{M}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$. What does this result in?\n4. How can we express this result in terms of the variables $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$? Can you write out the resulting matrix?\n5. Now let's compare this result with the desired matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} b & a \\\\ d & c \\end{pmatrix}$. Are there any constraints or conditions on the variables that need to be satisfied for the matrices to be equal?\n6. Is there a combination of $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$ that makes the matrices equal? Why or why not?\n7. What happens if we try different values for $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$? Can you find any values that satisfy the equation?\n8. Based on our exploration, what can we conclude about the existence of a matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ that swaps the columns of a matrix?\n9. How does this concept relate to other matrix properties or transformations that you have learned?"
