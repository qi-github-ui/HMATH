How can we find the period of the given graph?\n5. What is the relationship between the period of the given graph and the value of $b$ in the formula?\n6. Can you determine the value of $b$ for the given graph using the information given above?\n7. Is there any other way to find the value of $b$? If yes, what is it and how does it work? \n8. Can you give an example of a similar problem where we need to find a constant in a function based on given information about its graph?"
