Then triangle $ACM$ is a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle with $MC = 3$, $AC = 6,$ and $AM = 3\\sqrt{3}.$ Since triangle $AME$ is right, we use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $AE = 2 \\sqrt{7}$.\n\nThe area of triangle $DAE$ is\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot DE \\cdot AM = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\sqrt{3} = 3 \\sqrt{3}.\\]The area of triangle $DAE$ is also\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AD \\cdot AE \\cdot \\sin \\angle DAE = 14 \\sin \\angle DAE.\\]Therefore, $\\sin \\angle DAE = \\boxed{\\frac{3 \\sqrt{3}}{14}}.$",
