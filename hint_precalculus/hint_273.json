    "solution": "If $r = \\sec \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\cos \\theta},$ then $x = r \\cos \\theta = 1.$  Thus, the graph of $r = \\sec \\theta$ is simply the line $x = 1.$\n\nIf $r = \\csc \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sin \\theta},$ then $y = r \\sin \\theta = 1.$  Thus, the graph of $r = \\csc \\theta$ is simply the line $y = 1.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\nfill((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((-0.3,1)--(1.3,1),red);\ndraw((1,-0.3)--(1,1.3),red);\ndraw((-0.3,0)--(1.3,0));\ndraw((0,-0.3)--(0,1.3));\n[/asy]\n\nHence, the region we are interested in is simply the square with vertices $(0,0),$ $(1,0),$ $(1,1),$ and $(0,1),$ which has area $\\boxed{1}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define the region we are interested in?\n2. What are the equations of the graphs $r = \\sec \\theta$ and $r = \\csc \\theta$ in rectangular coordinates $(x, y)$?\n3. Can you analyze the equations to determine the boundaries of the region?\n4. What are the slope and y-intercept of the line $x = 1$? How about the line $y = 1$?\n5. How would you describe the shape of the region bounded by these lines?\n6. Can you sketch a rough graph of the region?\n7. What are the coordinates of the vertices of the region?\n8. How would you calculate the area of the region?\n9. Can you think of any alternative approaches to finding the area, based on different coordinate systems or integration?"
