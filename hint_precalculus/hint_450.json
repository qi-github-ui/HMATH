    "solution": "We know that the roots of $x^{10}+x^9 + \\cdots + x + 1$ are the eleventh roots of unity except $1.$ These are $e^{2 k \\pi i / 11},$ $k = 1,$ $2,$ $\\ldots,$ $10,$ which are just $\\omega,$ $\\omega^2,$ $\\ldots,$ $\\omega^{10}.$ Therefore, we must have\n$$(x-\\omega)(x-\\omega^2)\\cdots(x-\\omega^{10}) = x^{10} + x^9 + \\cdots + x + 1.$$Therefore,\n$$\n(2-w)(2-w^2)\\cdots(2-w^{10}) = 2^{10} + 2^9 + \\cdots + 2 + 1 = \\boxed{2047}.\n$$",
