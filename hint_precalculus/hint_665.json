How can we parameterize the line using the given direction vector and initial point?\n3. If we want to find a point on the line with an x-coordinate of 4, how can we set up an equation to solve for the parameter, t?\n4. What is the solution for the parameter, t, in the equation 2 + 3t = 4?\n5. How can we use the parameter, t, to find the corresponding z-coordinate of the point on the line?\n6. What is the z-coordinate of the point on the line when the x-coordinate is 4?"
