    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a phase shift is in the context of trigonometric functions?\n2. How does the general form $y = a \\sin (bx + c)$ relate to the given equation?\n3. What does the value of $c$, which is $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ in this case, represent in the equation?\n4. How does changing the value of $c$ affect the graph of the function?\n5. In this equation, $2x$ is inside the sine function. What effect does changing $2x$ have on the graph?\n6. If the original equation is $y = 2 \\sin 2x$, what is the phase shift of this graph?\n7. By comparing the two equations, what shift is introduced in the new equation $y = 2 \\sin \\left( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\right)$?\n8. How can you express the phase shift in terms of $\\pi$ units?\n9. Can you sketch the graphs of $y = 2 \\sin 2x$ and $y = 2 \\sin \\left( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\right)$ to visually compare the phase shift?"
