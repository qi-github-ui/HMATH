    "problem": "Find the $3 \\times 3$ matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ such that\n\\[\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v} = -4 \\mathbf{v}\\]for all three-dimensional vectors $\\mathbf{v}.$",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "Taking $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{i},$ we get that the first column of $\\mathbf{M}$ is\n\\[\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{i} = -4 \\mathbf{i} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Similarly, the second column of $\\mathbf{M}$ is $-4 \\mathbf{j},$ and the third column of $\\mathbf{M}$ is $-4 \\mathbf{k}.$  Therefore,\n\\[\\mathbf{M} = \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -4 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -4 \\end{pmatrix}}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define the concept of a matrix to someone who has never encountered it before? \n2. What does it mean for a matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ to satisfy the equation $\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{v} = -4 \\mathbf{v}$ for all $\\mathbf{v}$? \n3. What is the significance of the fact that the columns of $\\mathbf{M}$ are all scalar multiples of $\\begin{pmatrix} -4 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}$, respectively? \n4. Can you think of any other matrices that satisfy the same equation as $\\mathbf{M}$, and how would you go about finding them? \n5. What is the relationship between matrix multiplication and the operation of composing linear transformations? In what sense can we think of a matrix as representing a linear transformation? \n6. How can we use matrix operations to solve the system of equations $\\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$ for a given vector $\\mathbf{b}$? What properties of matrices and linear transformations are important for understanding this process?"
