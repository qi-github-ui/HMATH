    "problem": "Find the distance between the planes $x + 2y - 2z + 1 = 0$ and $2x + 4y - 4z + 5 = 0.$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "A point on the first plane is $(-1,0,0).$  Then from the formula for the distance from a point to a plane, the distance from $(-1,0,0)$ to the plane $2x + 4y - 4z + 5 = 0$ is\n\\[\\frac{|(2)(-1) + (4)(0) + (-4)(0) + 5|}{\\sqrt{2^2 + 4^2 + (-4)^2}} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\](Note that we can write the equation of the second plane as $x + 2y - 2z + \\frac{5}{2} = 0.$  Thus, both planes have the same normal vector, so they are parallel.)",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the formula for finding the distance from a point to a plane? How does it apply in this case?\n2. Why did we choose the point (-1, 0, 0) on the first plane? Is there a reason why this point is useful for our calculations?\n3. How do we compute the numerator of the distance formula? What does it represent in the context of the problem?\n4. What is the significance of the denominator in the distance formula? Why do we need to use the square root of the sum of squares of the coefficients?\n5. Can you describe the steps involved in simplifying the numerator and the denominator of the distance formula in this situation?\n6. Why do both planes have the same normal vector? How does this fact contribute to the conclusion that the planes are parallel?\n7. Are there any other methods or formulas that can be used to find the distance between planes? How do they compare to what we've done here?\n8. Can you think of any real-life scenarios where finding the distance between planes could be relevant? How would you approach those situations mathematically?"
