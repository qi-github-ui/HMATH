How is it related to the behavior of the graph?\n4. Based on the graph, can you determine the period of $y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2}$? If so, what is it?\n5. How does the period of $y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2}$ compare to the period of the tangent function?\n6. Are there any other functions that have a similar period to $y = \\tan \\frac{x}{2}$?"
