    "solution": "Let $a = \\cos x$ and $b = \\sin x,$ so\n\\[\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = 2 \\sqrt{2}.\\]Then\n\\[a + b = 2ab \\sqrt{2}.\\]Squaring both sides, we get\n\\[a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 8a^2 b^2.\\]Since $a^2 + b^2 = \\cos^2 x + \\sin^2 x = 1,$ $2ab + 1 = 8a^2 b^2,$ or\n\\[8a^2 b^2 - 2ab - 1 = 0.\\]This factors as $(2ab - 1)(4ab + 1) = 0,$ so $ab = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $ab = -\\frac{1}{4}.$\n\nIf $ab = \\frac{1}{2},$ then $a + b = \\sqrt{2}.$  Then $a$ and $b$ are the roots of\n\\[t^2 - t \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 0.\\]We can factor this as $\\left( t - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2 = 0,$ so $t = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.$  Therefore, $a = b = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},$ or\n\\[\\cos x = \\sin x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\]The only solution is $x = \\frac{\\pi}{4}.$\n\nIf $ab = -\\frac{1}{4},$ then $a + b = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.$  Then $a$ and $b$ are the roots of\n\\[t^2 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} t - \\frac{1}{4} = 0.\\]By the quadratic formula,\n\\[t = \\frac{-\\sqrt{2} \\pm \\sqrt{6}}{4}.\\]If $\\cos x = \\frac{-\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{6}}{4}$ and $\\sin x = \\frac{-\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}}{4},$ then $x = \\frac{19 \\pi}{12}.$  (To compute this angle, we can use the fact that $\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{12} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{6}}{4}$ and $\\cos \\frac{5 \\pi}{12} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2}}{4}.$)\n\nIf $\\cos x = \\frac{-\\sqrt{2} - \\sqrt{6}}{4}$ and $\\sin x = \\frac{-\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{6}}{4},$ then $x = \\frac{11 \\pi}{12}.$\n\nHence, the sum of all solutions is $\\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{19 \\pi}{12} + \\frac{11 \\pi}{12} = \\boxed{\\frac{11 \\pi}{4}}.$",

By substituting $a$ and $b$ as $\\cos x$ and $\\sin x$ respectively, we obtained a new equation. Can you explain why we made this substitution? What does it help us achieve?\n4. In the new equation, we squared both sides to eliminate the square roots. Why did we do this? Are there any potential pitfalls when squaring both sides of an equation?\n5. By manipulating the equation, we ended up with a quadratic equation in terms of $ab$. How did we obtain this quadratic equation? \n6. Can you explain the process of factoring the quadratic equation and obtaining the values of $ab$? \n7.
