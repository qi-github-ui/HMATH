    "socratic_questions": "1. What is a complex number, and how is it written in polar form?\n2. What is the product of the two given complex numbers, and how is it written in polar form?\n3. How can we express the polar form of the product in a way that conforms to the given restrictions on $r$ and $\\theta$?\n4. Why do we want $r$ to be greater than 0, and how can we modify the product to satisfy this condition?\n5. What is the resulting polar form of the product, and how can we check our answer?\n6. Can you think of other problems in which we need to express a complex number in polar form, and how do the steps in solving them compare to this problem?"
