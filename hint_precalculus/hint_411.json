How is the determinant affected when all the elements in a row or a column of the matrix are multiplied by the same constant?\n4. If the determinant of a matrix is zero, what does that tell us about the matrix?\n5. Given the determinant of a 2x2 matrix, can you find the values of its elements?\n6. How does the determinant change when the rows or columns of a matrix are interchanged?\n7. Using the properties of determinants, can you explain how to find the determinant of the matrix $\\begin{vmatrix} 2a & 2b \\\\ 2c & 2d \\end{vmatrix}$ in terms of the determinant of the matrix $\\begin{vmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{vmatrix}$? \n8. Can you use the property mentioned in the previous question to find the determinant of the matrix $\\begin{vmatrix} 3 & 4 \\\\ 6 & 8 \\end{vmatrix}$ using the determinant of the matrix $\\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{vmatrix}$?"
