    "solution": "To find a unit vector that is orthogonal to both $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix},$ we take their cross product:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]This vector has magnitude 3, so we divide by 3 to get a unit vector: $\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2/3 \\\\ -2/3 \\\\ -1/3 \\end{pmatrix}}.$\n\nWe could also divide by $-3$ to get $\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -2/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\\\ 1/3 \\end{pmatrix}}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the two vectors that we are given, and what is the relationship between them?\n2. What is the definition of a unit vector, and why do we want to find one that is orthogonal to the given vectors?\n3. How do we compute the cross product of two vectors, and what is the resulting vector geometrically?\n4. What is the magnitude of the vector we obtained from the cross product, and why do we divide by this magnitude to obtain a unit vector?\n5. How do we know that the vector we obtained is orthogonal to both of the given vectors?\n6. Are there any other ways to find a vector that is orthogonal to two given vectors, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of these methods?\n7. Can we visualize the resulting vector in three-dimensional space, and what is its significance in geometry and physics?"
