    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the projection of one vector onto another means geometrically?\n2. How does the dot product play a role in finding the projection of one vector onto another?\n3. Given that the dot product of vectors v and w is 10, what does this tell us about the angle between these two vectors?\n4. How can we use the norm of vectors v and w to find the norm of the projection of v onto w?\n5. What formula or equation can we use to calculate the norm of the projection of v onto w?\n6. Applying this formula, what is the norm of the projection of v onto w in this case given that ||v|| = 3, ||w|| = 7, and v Â· w = 10?"
