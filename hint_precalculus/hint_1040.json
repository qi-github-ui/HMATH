    "problem": "There are infinitely many positive integers $k$ which satisfy the equation\n\\[\\cos^2 (k^2 + 6^2)^\\circ = 1.\\]Enter the two smallest solutions, separated by commas.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "Note that $\\cos^2 \\theta = 1$ if and only if $\\theta$ is a multiple of $180^\\circ.$  Thus, we seek $k$ so that\n\\[k^2 + 36 = 180n\\]for some nonnegative integer $n.$  Then\n\\[k^2 = 180n - 36 = 36 (5n - 1).\\]Hence, $k$ must be a multiple of 6.  We see that $k = 6$ does not work, but $k = \\boxed{12}$ and $k = \\boxed{18}$ work, so these are the two smallest solutions.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the given equation represents, and what is the unknown variable we need to find?\n2. Based on the given note, what does it mean when $\\cos^2 \\theta = 1$? How can we use this information to find possible values of $k$ that satisfy the equation?\n3. Can you state the algebraic equation that represents the information we have about $k$? How can we solve this equation to find possible values of $k$?\n4. What do we observe about the values of $k$ that can satisfy the equation? Can you explain why $k$ must be a multiple of 6?\n5. What are the smallest possible values of $k$ that satisfy the equation, based on the information we have so far? Can you check if these values indeed satisfy the equation?\n6. Are there any other values of $k$ that could potentially satisfy the equation? How can we find them using the same reasoning as before?"
