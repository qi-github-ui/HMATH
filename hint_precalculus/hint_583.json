    "solution": "Let $\\mathbf{P}$ denote the given matrix, so $\\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{v}$ is the projection of $\\mathbf{v}$ onto $\\ell.$  In particular, $\\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{v}$ lies on $\\ell$ for any vector $\\mathbf{v}.$  So, we can take $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{i}.$  Then\n\\[\\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{i} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{15} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{15} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{15} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Thus, the direction vector we seek is $\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix}}.$",
