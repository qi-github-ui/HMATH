    "solution": "A side of square I has length 3, while a side of square II has length 6 (all sides have equal length).  Therefore, a side of square III has length 9.  Since the side length of square I is $\\frac{1}{3}$ that of square III, and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their side lengths, the ratio of the area of square I to square III is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9}$.   Alternately, you can just calculate the areas: square I has an area of 9, square III has an area of 81, thus, the ratio of their areas is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. How would you find the side length of square III if you know the side lengths of squares I and II?\n3. What is the relationship between the side lengths and areas of squares?\n4. How can we use this relationship to find the ratio of the areas of squares I and III?\n5. Can you explain why the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their side lengths?\n6. Is there another method you can think of to calculate the ratio of the areas of squares I and III?\n7. How would the ratio of the areas change if the side lengths of squares I and II were different?\n8. What would happen to the ratio of the areas if the side length of square III was doubled?\n9. Is it possible to find the exact ratio of the areas without calculating the areas directly?"
