    "solution": "The x and y axis of this graph break it down into four triangles each with the same area. We find that the x and y intercepts of this graph are $(0,5)$, $(0,-5)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$. This means that the area of each triangle is $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot5\\cdot10=25.$$ Therefore, the total area is $4\\cdot25=\\boxed{100}$ square units.",

If you were to use the method of dividing the graph into triangles, how would you determine the coordinates of the triangle vertices?\n4. Why is it possible to divide the graph into triangles? What characteristics make it suitable for this method?\n5. What is the area of each individual triangle? How would you verify that the area calculation is correct?\n6. Can you think of other types of graphs where a similar approach of dividing into triangles might be applicable?\n7. Are there any alternative methods you can think of to find the area enclosed by this graph?\n8. How does the size of the triangles change if the equation of the graph is modified?"
