    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ with vertices $A(1, -3)$, $B(-2, 0)$ and $C(4, 3)$ is reflected over the $y$-axis to form triangle $A'B'C'$. What is the length of a segment drawn from $A$ to $A'$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Reflecting a point over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coefficient.  So if $A$ is $(1,-3)$, $A'$ will be $(-1, -3)$.  The segment is a horizontal line of length $1+1=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what reflecting a point over the y-axis means and how it affects the coordinates of the point?\n2. What are the coordinates of point A after being reflected over the y-axis?\n3. How do we find the length of the segment from A to A'?\n4. Which formula or theorem can we use to calculate the length of the segment?\n5. Can you show how to apply the formula or theorem to find the length of the segment?\n6. How would the length of the segment change if we reflected the triangle over the x-axis instead of the y-axis?"
