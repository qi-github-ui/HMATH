    "problem": "Let $n$ equal the number of sides in a regular polygon. For $3\\leq n < 10$, how many values of $n$ result in a regular polygon where the common degree measure of the interior angles is not an integer?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The number of degrees is the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$.  If the $n$-gon is regular, then each angle measures $\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$ degrees.  If $n=3$, 4, 5, 6, or 9, then $n$ divides evenly into 180, so the number of degrees in each angle is an integer.  If $n=7$, then the number of degrees is $180\\cdot5/7=900/7$, which is not an integer.  If $n=8$, the number of degrees in each angle is $180\\cdot 6/8=135$.  Therefore, only $\\boxed{1}$ value of $n$ between 3 and 9 results in a non-integer degree measure for each interior angle of a regular $n$-gon.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a regular polygon is and how it differs from an irregular polygon?\n2. How can we calculate the sum of the interior angles for any polygon?\n3. In the case of a regular polygon, how can we determine the measure of each interior angle?\n4. What values of n between 3 and 10 result in a regular polygon with an integer degree measure for each interior angle?\n5. For which value of n does the regular polygon have a non-integer degree measure for each interior angle? How did you arrive at this conclusion?\n6. Can you think of any other characteristics that might result in a regular polygon having a non-integer degree measure for each interior angle?"
