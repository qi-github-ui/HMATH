    "problem": "How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone having a diameter of 10cm and a height of 6cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The radius of the base of the cone is $10/2 = 5$, so the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{50 \\pi}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the formula for finding the volume of a cone?\n2. Can you explain how the diameter and height of the cone are related to its volume?\n3. How can we convert the diameter of a cone to its radius?\n4. What is the formula for the area of a circle, and how is it used to find the volume of a cone?\n5. What units are typically used to measure the volume of a cone, and why?\n6. How can we simplify the expression for the volume of the cone using mathematical operations?\n7. Can you check your answer to make sure it makes sense in the context of the problem?"
