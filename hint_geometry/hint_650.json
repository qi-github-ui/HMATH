Shown in the diagram above, let the parallelogram be $ABCD$, with $\\overline{AD}$ one of the short sides.  Drawing the altitude from $D$ to $\\overline{AB}$ gives us 30-60-90 triangle $AXD$, from which we find $XD = (AD/2)\\sqrt{3} = 4\\sqrt{3}$, so the area of $ABCD$ is $(AB)(XD) = \\boxed{60\\sqrt{3}}$.",
