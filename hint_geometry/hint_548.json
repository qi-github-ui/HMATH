    "solution": "The area of a triangle is given by the formula $\\frac 12 bh$. Both $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle ADC$ share the same height $AB$. Let $[ABD]$ be the area of $\\triangle ABD$ and $[ADC]$ be the area of $\\triangle ADC$. It follows that $\\frac{[ABD]}{[ADC]} = \\frac{\\frac 12 \\cdot BD \\cdot h}{\\frac 12 \\cdot DC \\cdot h} = \\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{4}{3}$. Thus, $[ADC] = \\frac 34 [ABD] = \\frac 34 \\cdot 24 = \\boxed{18}$.",
