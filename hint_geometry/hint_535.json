    "solution": "To begin with, let $DF = x$ and $FA = 9 - x$. $\\triangle{DFA}$ is a right triangle, so we can solve for $x$ by applying the Pythagorean Theorem: $x^2 + 9 = 81 - 18x + x^2$, so $18x = 72$, or $x = 4$. By applying the same argument to $\\triangle{EAB}$, we can see that $FA = EA = 5$. Drop a perpendicular from $F$ to $EA$ and call the intersection point $P$. $PFDA$ is a rectangle, so we know that $PA = FD = 4$, so $PE = 5 - 4 = 1$. Furthermore, we know that $FP = DA = 3$. Now, we have right triangle $\\triangle{FPE}$ with legs $1$ and $3$, so we can solve for $FE$ by applying the Pythagorean Theorem: $FE = \\sqrt{1+9} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.",
