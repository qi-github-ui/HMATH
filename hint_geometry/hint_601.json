    "solution": "We first find the length of line segment $FG$. Since $DC$ has length $6$ and $DF$ and $GC$ have lengths $1$ and $2$ respectively, $FG$ must have length $3$. Next, we notice that $DC$ and $AB$ are parallel so $\\angle EFG \\cong \\angle EAB$ because they are corresponding angles. Similarly, $\\angle EGF \\cong \\angle EBA$. Now that we have two pairs of congruent angles, we know that $\\triangle FEG \\sim \\triangle AEB$ by Angle-Angle Similarity.\n\nBecause the two triangles are similar, we have that the ratio of the altitudes of $\\triangle FEG$ to $\\triangle AEB$ equals the ratio of the bases. $FG:AB=3:6=1:2$, so the the ratio of the altitude of $\\triangle FEG$ to that of $\\triangle AEB$ is also $1:2$. Thus, the height of the rectangle $ABCD$ must be half of the altitude of $\\triangle AEB$. Since the height of rectangle $ABCD$ is $3$, the altitude of $\\triangle AEB$ must be $6$. Now that we know that the base and altitude of $\\triangle AEB$ are both $6$, we know that the area of triangle $AEB$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$base $\\times$ height $= (\\frac{1}{2})(6)(6) = \\boxed{18}$ square units.",
