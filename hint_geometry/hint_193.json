    "problem": "In parallelogram $ABCD$, $AB = 38$ cm, $BC = 3y^3$ cm, $CD = 2x +4$ cm, and $AD = 24$ cm. What is the product of $x$ and $y$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since opposite sides of a parallelogram have the same length, we have the equations $$AB=CD\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad38=2x+4\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad x=17$$and $$BC=AD\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad3y^3=24\\qquad\\Rightarrow\\qquad y=2.$$The product of $x$ and $y$ is then $17\\cdot2=\\boxed{34}$.",
