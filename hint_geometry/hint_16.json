    "problem": "The formula for the total surface area of a cylinder is $SA = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh,$ where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. A particular solid right cylinder of radius 2 feet has a total surface area of $12\\pi$ square feet. What is the height of this cylinder?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the height of the cylinder be $h$; we then have \\[SA = 2\\pi (2^2)+2\\pi (2)(h) = 12\\pi.\\]Solving yields $4\\pi h = 4 \\pi$ so $h = \\boxed{1}$ foot.",
