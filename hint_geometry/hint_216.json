    "problem": "Six boys stood equally spaced on a circle of radius 40 feet. Each boy walked to all of the other non-adjacent persons on the circle, shook their hands and then returned to his original spot on the circle before the next boy started his trip to shake hands with all of the other non-adjacent boys on the circle. After all six boys had done this, what is the least distance in feet that could have been traveled? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",

    "solution": "The thicker solid line in the diagram shows the shortest path that one person could travel. The circle is equally divided into six 60-degree arcs, so the short distance is 40 feet, the same as a radius. The dotted line is a diameter that separates the quadrilateral into two 30-60-90 triangles. The longer leg is $(80\\sqrt {3})/2$, or $40\\sqrt{3}$ feet. Each person travels $40\\sqrt{3} + 40 + 40 + 40\\sqrt{3} = 80 + 80\\sqrt{3}$ feet. After all six people did this, $6(80 + 80\\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{480 + 480\\sqrt{3}\\text{ feet}}$ had been traveled.

Can you explain what it means for each boy to shake hands with all the other non-adjacent boys?\n4. Can you identify any symmetries or patterns in the circle that could help us find the shortest distance traveled by each boy?\n5. What is the shortest distance that one person could travel on the circle? Why?\n6. What geometric shape is formed by the dotted line in the diagram? How can we use this shape to find the longer leg of each triangle?\n7. How do we calculate the total distance traveled by each boy? Can you explain the reasoning behind the calculation formula?\n8. How can we find the total distance traveled by all six boys?\n9. What is the final answer to the problem? Can you express it in simplest radical form?\n10. Can you think of any other scenarios or situations where we could apply similar geometric thinking and steps?"
