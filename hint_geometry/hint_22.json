    "problem": "Kadin makes a snowman by stacking snowballs of radius 2 inches, 3 inches, and 5 inches.  Assuming all his snowballs are spherical, what is the total volume of snow he uses, in cubic inches?  Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Thus, the snowballs with radius 2, 3, and 5 inches have volumes $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3)$, $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3^3)$, and $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(5^3)$ cubic inches respectively.  The total volume of snow used is thus  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3)+\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3^3)+\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(5^3)&=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3+3^3+5^3)\\\\\n&=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(8+27+125)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{640}{3}\\pi}.\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the equation used to calculate the volume of a sphere with radius $r$?\n2. Using the equation from question 1, what are the volumes of the snowballs with radii 2, 3, and 5 inches?\n3. How can we find the total volume of snow used by Kadin?\n4. Can you express the total volume of snow used in terms of $\\pi$?\n5. How can we combine the volumes of the individual snowballs to calculate the total volume?\n6. What is the calculation for the total volume of snow used? Please provide the final result in terms of $\\pi$."
