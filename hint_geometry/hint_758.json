    "solution": "The original prism has 5 faces, 9 edges, and 6 vertices.  If the new pyramid is added to a triangular face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, and 3 new faces.  If instead the new pyramid is added to a quadrilateral face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 4 new edges, and 4 new faces.  So, we maximize the sum by adding a pyramid to a quadrilateral face.  This gives us a solid with $5-1+4 = 8$ faces, $9+4=13$ edges, and $6 + 1 = 7$ vertices.  The sum of these is $\\boxed{28}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many faces does the original triangular prism have?\n2. How many edges does the original triangular prism have?\n3. How many vertices does the original triangular prism have?\n4. If a new pyramid is added to the prism, how many faces will the resulting shape have?\n5. If the new pyramid is added to a triangular face, how many new faces, edges, and vertices will be added?\n6. If the new pyramid is added to a quadrilateral face, how many new faces, edges, and vertices will be added?\n7. Which option, adding to a triangular face or a quadrilateral face, will result in the maximum sum of exterior faces, vertices, and edges?\n8. What is the maximum sum of exterior faces, vertices, and edges after adding the pyramid to the quadrilateral face?"
