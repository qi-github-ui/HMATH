    "solution": "Writing $BP=x$ and $PD=6-x$, we have that $BP < 3$. Power of a point at $P$ gives $AP \\cdot PC = BP \\cdot PD$ or $8=x(6-x)$. This can be solved for $x=2$ and $x=4$, and we discard the latter, leaving $BP = \\boxed{2}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the given situation and identify any key information or variables related to the problem?\n2. How can we use the concept of power of a point to approach this problem? What formula is involved?\n3. How can we use the given information to set up an equation involving $x$, where $BP=x$ and $PD=6-x$?\n4. How does solving the equation $8=x(6-x)$ help us find the value of $x$, and thus the length of $BP$?\n5. Are there any steps or assumptions we made in this problem that we should double check or justify? \n6. Can you think of a similar problem or application of the power of a point theorem in geometry?"
