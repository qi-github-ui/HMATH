    "solution": "By Pythagoras, triangle $ABC$ is right with $\\angle B = 90^\\circ$.  Then the area of triangle $ABC$ is $1/2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BC = 1/2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 6$.\n\nSince $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, the areas of triangles $BCG$, $CAG$, and $ABG$ are all one-third the area of triangle $ABC$, namely $6/3 = 2$.\n\nWe can view $PG$ as the height of triangle $BCG$ with respect to base $BC$.  Then \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot GP \\cdot BC = 2,\\]so $GP = 4/BC = 4/4 = 1$.  Similarly, $GQ = 4/AC = 4/5$ and $GR = 4/AB = 4/3$.  Therefore, $GP + GQ + GR = 1 + 4/5 + 4/3 = \\boxed{\\frac{47}{15}}$.",

In this specific triangle, what are the lengths of the medians $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$?\n4. How do we find the area of triangle $ABC$ using the lengths of the sides, and what is its value in this case?\n5. How does the area of triangle $BCG$ relate to the area of triangle $ABC$? What is its value?\n6. How can we find the length of $GP$ using the area of triangle $BCG$?\n7. Using the same method, can you find the lengths of $GQ$ and $GR$?\n8. What is the value of $GP + GQ + GR$?"
