    "problem": "How many integer side lengths are possible to complete a triangle in which the other sides measure 6 units and 3 units?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units. Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units. There are $\\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the Triangle Inequality and how does it relate to this problem?\n2. Can you explain why the unknown side length must be less than 9 units and greater than 3 units?\n3. How did you determine that there are 5 possible integer side lengths?\n4. Can you list the 5 possible integer side lengths?\n5. How would the number of possible integer side lengths change if the other sides measured 8 units and 4 units instead?\n6. Can you think of any other geometric concepts that could be used to solve this problem?"
