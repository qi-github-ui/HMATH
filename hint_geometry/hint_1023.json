    "problem": "The longer leg of a right triangle is $1$ foot shorter than twice the length of the shorter leg. The area of the triangle is $60$ square feet. What is the length of the hypotenuse, in feet?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If $x$ represents the length of the shorter leg, then the two legs are $x$ and $2x-1$. In a right triangle, the length of one leg is the base and the length of the other leg is the height, so the area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}bh=\\frac{1}{2}x(2x-1)$. We set this equal to 60 and solve for $x$. \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}(2x^2-x)&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n2x^2-x&=120\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n2x^2-x-120&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(2x+15)(x-8)&=0\n\\end{align*} Since $x$ must be positive, we get that $x=8$. The shorter leg is 8 feet long and the longer leg is $2(8)-1=15$ feet long. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse or we recognize that 8 and 15 are part of the Pythagorean triple $8:15:17$. The hypotenuse of the right triangle is $\\boxed{17}$ feet long.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the problem and identify what is being asked for?\n2. What is the formula for the area of a triangle and how can we use it to solve this problem?\n3. How can we find the length of the shorter leg, given that the longer leg is 1 foot shorter than twice the shorter leg?\n4. Once we know the length of the shorter leg, how can we find the length of the longer leg?\n5. How can we use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse?\n6. Are there any Pythagorean triples we can use to easily find the length of the hypotenuse?\n7. Can you explain why there are only two solutions for the length of the shorter leg in this problem?\n8. How can we check our answer to ensure that it is correct?"
