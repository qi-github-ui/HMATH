    "problem": "The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the original volume of the cylinder?\n2. How does doubling the radius affect the volume of the cylinder?\n3. How does tripling the height affect the volume of the cylinder?\n4. Can you write an expression for the volume of the new cylinder in terms of the original radius and height?\n5. How can we find the new volume if we know the original volume is 10 cubic feet?\n6. What is the final volume of the cylinder after doubling the radius and tripling the height?"
