    "solution": "Let $x = 14.8$ and $y = 28.3$.  Then the volume of cone $A$ is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi x^2 y,\\] and the volume of cone $B$ is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi y^2 x,\\] so the desired ratio is \\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\pi x^2 y}{\\frac{1}{3} \\pi xy^2} = \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{14.8}{28.3} = \\boxed{\\frac{148}{283}}.\\]",
