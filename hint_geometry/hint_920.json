    "solution": "Each small congruent right triangle in the diagram has the same area, which we will call $K$.  Since $\\triangle ABG$ consists of two small triangles, $[\\triangle ABG]= 2K$.  Similarly, $\\triangle ACE$ is built from six small triangles, so $[\\triangle ACE] = 6K$.  Hence the ratio of these areas is $2K/6K = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

What is the area of one of the smaller equilateral triangles in the diagram, and how is it related to the area of the regular hexagon?\n3. How is the larger equilateral triangle $\\triangle ACE$ constructed from the smaller equilateral triangles, and how many of the smaller triangles are used?\n4. What is the area of the larger equilateral triangle $\\triangle ACE$ in terms of the area of one of the smaller equilateral triangles?\n5. How does the ratio of the areas $[\\triangle ABG]/[\\triangle ACE]$ relate to the number of small equilateral triangles used to construct each triangle?\n6. Can you think of other geometric shapes and constructions that involve similar relationships between areas and side lengths? How do these relate to the concept of proportionality?"
