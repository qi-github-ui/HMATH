    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The side length of the square is equal to twice the diameter of one of the circles, so the area of the square is $(20\\text{ in})(20\\text{ in})=\\boxed{400}$ square inches.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you describe the arrangement of the square and four circles?\n2. What is the relationship between the side length of the square and the diameter of one of the circles?\n3. How can we determine the side length of the square based on the information provided?\n4. What is the formula to calculate the area of a square? Can you apply it to find the area?\n5. Can you explain why multiplying the side length by itself gives us the area of the square?\n6. How does the information about the circles help us find the area of the square?\n7. Can you generalize this method to find the area of a square in similar situations?\n8. Are there any other geometric properties or concepts related to this problem that we can explore?"
