    "solution": "By the triangle inequality on triangle $ABC$, $BC > AC - AB = 12 - 5 = 7$, and by the triangle inequality on triangle $BCD$, $BC > BD - CD = 20 - 8 = 12$.  Hence, $BC$ must be at least $\\boxed{13}$ centimeters.  (And it is easy to verify that it is possible for $BC$ to be 13 centimeters.",
