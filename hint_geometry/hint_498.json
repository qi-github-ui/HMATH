    "solution": "The two bases are circles, and the area of a circle is $\\pi r^2$. If the area of the upper base (which is also the base of the small cone) is $25\\pi$ sq cm, then its radius is $5$ cm, and the radius of the lower base is $15$ cm.   The upper base, therefore, has a radius that is $\\frac{1}{3}$ the size of the radius of the smaller base.  Because the slope of the sides of a cone is uniform, the frustum must have been cut off $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the way up the cone, so $x$ is $\\frac13$ of the total height of the cone, $H$.  We can now solve for $x$, because we know that the height of the frustum, $24$ cm is $\\frac23$ of the total height. \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{2}{3}H&=24\\\\\nH&=36\\\\\nx&=H\\times\\frac{1}{3}\\\\\nx&=36\\times\\frac{1}{3}\\\\\nx&=12\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the height of the small cone is $\\boxed{12}$ centimeters.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is a frustum of a cone, and how can it be formed by cutting off a smaller cone from a larger cone?\n2. Can you describe the given frustum in terms of its dimensions (altitude, area of the lower base, and area of the upper base)?\n3. How can we relate the area of a circle to its radius?\n4. Using the information given about the frustum's bases, can you determine the radii of the lower and upper bases?\n5. What can we conclude about the ratio between the radii of the upper and lower bases?\n6. How does the slope of the sides of a cone affect the location where the frustum is cut off?\n7. Can you express the height of the small cone (the one that was cut off) in terms of the total height of the cone and the given dimensions of the frustum?\n8. How can we set up and solve an equation to find the height of the small cone?\n9. What is the solution to the equation, and what does it represent in the context of the problem?"
