    "problem": "How many different isosceles triangles have integer side lengths and perimeter 23?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Because the perimeter of such a triangle is 23, and the sum of the two equal side lengths is even, the length of the base is odd. Also, the length of the base is less than the sum of the other two side lengths, so it is less than half of 23. Thus the $\\boxed{6}$ possible triangles have side lengths 1, 11, 11; 3, 10, 10; 5, 9, 9; 7, 8, 8; 9, 7, 7 and 11, 6, 6.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is an isosceles triangle? Can you describe its characteristics?\n2. What does it mean for the side lengths of a triangle to be integers? How does that affect the problem?\n3. What is the perimeter of a triangle? Can you relate it to the side lengths of an isosceles triangle?\n4. How many equal side lengths does an isosceles triangle have? How does that relate to the given information of a perimeter of 23?\n5. Why does the sum of the two equal side lengths have to be even?\n6. What can you conclude about the length of the base of the isosceles triangle based on the given information of a perimeter of 23?\n7. Why is the length of the base less than half of 23? \n8. How can you use these constraints to determine the possible values for the side lengths of the isosceles triangle?\n9. Can you list all the different possible side length combinations that satisfy the constraints? How would you verify the validity of each combination?\n10. Can you think of any other similar problems involving isosceles triangles and integer side lengths that might require a similar thought process and steps to solve?"
