    "solution": "We can see that $\\angle ACB = 40^\\circ$ must be half of the central angle formed by the arc ${AB},$ or $80^\\circ.$ Likewise, $\\angle CAD = 30^\\circ$ must be half of the central angle formed by the arc ${CD},$ or $60^\\circ.$ Then, we can see that the angles formed by arcs ${BC}$ and ${DA}$ must sum to $360^\\circ - (80^\\circ + 60^\\circ) = 220^\\circ.$ That means the sum $\\angle CAB + \\angle ACD$ must be half of that, or $\\boxed{110^\\circ}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the angles formed by arcs AB and CD in terms of the given information?\n2. What can you conclude about the central angles formed by arcs AB and CD?\n3. How can you relate the central angles to the angles within the circle, specifically angles ACB and CAD?\n4. What relationships can you identify between angles ACB and CAD and the angles formed by arcs BC and DA?\n5. How can you determine the sum of angles CAB and ACD?\n6. Can you generalize this approach to finding the sum of angles in other similar configurations?\n7. What is the final result, and how does it relate to the given problem?"
