    "solution": "$\\angle CDF = \\angle AEB$ and $\\angle BAE = \\angle CFD$, so we know that $\\bigtriangleup AEB \\sim \\bigtriangleup FDC$.  Thus, denoting the side length of $BEFC$ as $x$, we can create the ratios: $\\frac{28}{x} = \\frac{x}{58} \\Rightarrow x^2 = 1624$, and since $x^2$ is the area of square $BCFE$, $\\boxed{1624}$ is the answer.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain how triangle $AGD$ and square $BCFE$ are related? \n2. What do we know about the angles in triangles $AEB$ and $FDC$? \n3. How can we use these angle relationships to find the side length of the square? \n4. What is the equation that relates the side length of the square to the lengths of segments $AB$ and $CD$? \n5. Can you solve this equation to find the value of the side length? \n6. How do we use the side length to find the area of the square? \n7. Are there any other ways to approach this problem?"
