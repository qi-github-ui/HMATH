    "problem": "The volume of a cylinder is $54\\pi$ $\\text{cm}^3$. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone with the same radius and height as the cylinder? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.

    "solution": "A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $(1/3)\\pi r^2 h$; a cylinder with the same radius and height has volume $\\pi r^2 h$.  Thus we see the volume of the corresponding cone has 1/3 the volume of the cylinder, which is $(1/3)(54\\pi = \\boxed{18\\pi}$ cubic cm.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the problem is asking for? \n2. How would you calculate the volume of the cylinder? \n3. How does the formula for the volume of a cone compare to the formula for the volume of a cylinder? \n4. How can you use the volume of the cylinder to find the volume of the cone? \n5. What is the relationship between the volumes of the cylinder and cone with the same radius and height? \n6. How can you express the volume of the cone in terms of pi?"
