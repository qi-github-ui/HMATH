    "problem": "Brad has a cylindrical barrel with radius 10 inches and height 15 inches.  He wants to fill it from a well, using a bucket in the shape of a hemisphere with a radius of 10 inches. How many trips must Brad make to the well in order to fill the barrel?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "We start by finding the volume of the bucket and the volume of the barrel.  Let $r$ be ten inches.   The bucket is half of a sphere of radius $r$, so the volume it can hold is \\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3 . \\]On the other hand, the barrel is a cylinder of radius $r$ and height $15 \\text{ in} = \\frac{3}{2} r$, so its volume is \\[ \\pi r^2 \\cdot \\text{height} = \\frac{3}{2} \\pi r^3 . \\]Therefore the ratio of the volume of the barrel to the volume of the bucket is \\[ \\frac{(3/2) \\pi r^3}{(2/3) \\pi r^3} = \\frac{9}{4}\n= 2 + \\frac{1}{4} . \\]Thus two buckets will not suffice to fill the barrel, but three will, so Brad needs $\\boxed{3}$ trips to the well.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information in the problem?\n2. What is the shape of the bucket? How can we calculate its volume?\n3. What is the shape of the barrel? How can we calculate its volume?\n4. What is the relationship between the volume of the barrel and the volume of the bucket?\n5. Can one bucket fill the entire barrel? Why or why not?\n6. How many buckets will be needed to fill the barrel completely?\n7. Is there any other information we need to consider in order to solve the problem?\n8. Can this method of calculating volumes be applied to other shapes as well?\n9. Can you think of any modifications to the problem that would require different calculations or methods?\n10. Can we generalize this problem to find out how many trips are needed to fill a barrel of any size using a bucket of any size?"
