    "problem": "Parallelogram $ABCD$ has vertices $A(3,3)$, $B(-3,-3)$, $C(-9,-3)$, and $D(-3,3)$. If a point is selected at random from the region determined by the parallelogram, what is the probability that the point is not above the $x$-axis? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "Let us first call the point where the $x$-axis intersects side $\\overline{AB}$ point $E$ and where it intersects $\\overline{CD}$ point $F$. [asy]\ndraw((-12,0)--(6,0),Arrows);\ndraw((0,-6)--(0,6),Arrows);\n\nfor(int i = -11; i < 6; ++i)\n{\n\ndraw((i,.5)--(i,-.5));\n}\n\nfor(int i = -5; i < 6; ++i)\n{\n\ndraw((.5,i)--(-.5,i));\n}\n\ndot((3,3));\ndot((-3,-3));\ndot((-9,-3));\ndot((-3,3));\ndot((0,0));\ndot((-6,0));\n\ndraw((3,3)--(-3,-3)--(-9,-3)--(-3,3)--cycle, linewidth(.65));\ndraw((0,0)--(-6,0), linewidth(.65));\n\nlabel(\"A\",(3,3),NE);\nlabel(\"B\",(-3,-3),SE);\nlabel(\"C\",(-9,-3),SW);\nlabel(\"D\",(-3,3),NW);\nlabel(\"F\",(-6,0),NW);\nlabel(\"E\",(0,0),NW);\n[/asy] Now, since the $x$-axis is parallel to bases $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ of the parallelogram, $\\overline{EF}$ is parallel to the two bases and splits parallelogram $ABCD$ into two smaller parallelograms $AEFD$ and $EBCF$. Since the height of each of these parallelograms is $3$ and the length of their bases equals $AD=BC=6$, both parallelograms must have the same area. Half of parallelogram $ABCD$'s area is above the $x$-axis and half is below, so there is a $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ probability that the point selected is not above the $x$-axis.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. What do you know about parallelograms and their properties?\n3. How can we determine the area of parallelogram ABCD?\n4. Can you explain why the line EF splits parallelogram ABCD into two equal areas?\n5. How does the intersection of the x-axis with sides AB and CD help in finding the area of the parallelogram?\n6. What is the relationship between the length of the base and the height of parallelogram AEFD and parallelogram EBCF?\n7. How does the fact that the selected point is not above the x-axis relate to the areas of parallelogram AEFD and parallelogram EBCF?\n8. Can you think of any other ways to find the probability of the selected point not being above the x-axis in this scenario?"
