    "solution": "Since $\\angle RIP$ is inscribed in arc $RP$, the measure of arc $RP$ is $2\\angle RIP = 72^\\circ$.  Therefore, arc $RP$ is $\\frac{72}{360} =\\frac15$ of the circumference of the whole circle.  The circle's circumference is $2OR\\pi = 20\\pi$ cm, so the length of arc $RP$ is $\\frac15\\cdot 20\\pi = \\boxed{4\\pi}$ cm.",
