    "solution": "There are two diagonals, such as $x$, in each of the six faces for a total of twelve face diagonals. There are also four space diagonals, such as $y$, which are within the cube. This makes a total of $\\boxed{16}$.",

How many diagonals are there in each face of the cube?\n6. Are all face diagonals the same length? Why or why not?\n7. How many space diagonals are there in a cube?\n8. Are all space diagonals the same length? Why or why not?\n9. How can we find the total number of diagonals in a cube?\n10. Can you provide an explanation or formula to calculate the total number of diagonals in any given cube?"
