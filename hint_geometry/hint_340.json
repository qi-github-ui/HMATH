    "solution": "Let $h$ be the height of the trapezoid.  The height of the trapezoid is also a height of $ABC$ and of $ADC$.  Specifically, we have $[ABC] = (AB)(h)/2$ and $[ADC] = (CD)(h)/2$, so $[ABC]:[ADC] = AB:CD$.  Since we are given that this area ratio equals $7:3$, we know that $AB:CD = 7:3$.  Therefore, $AB = 7x$ and $CD = 3x$ for some  value of $x$.  Since $AB + CD = 210$ cm, we have $7x+3x=210$, so $10x=210$ and $x=21$. Therefore,  $AB=7 \\times 21 = \\boxed{147\\text{ cm}}$.",
