    "problem": "What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the given dimensions of the right rectangular prism?\n2. How do we find the volume of a right rectangular prism?\n3. How do the given area measurements of the adjacent faces relate to the dimensions of the prism?\n4. How can we use these area measurements to find the dimensions of the prism?\n5. How can we use the dimensions of the prism to find the volume?\n6. Are there any other methods we can use to find the volume of the prism?\n7. How would changing the dimensions of the faces affect the volume of the prism?\n8. Can we generalize our method for finding the volume of a right rectangular prism to other types of prisms?"
