To find $\\sin 315^\\circ$, we need to find the $y$-coordinate of $P$. How can we use the coordinates of $P$ to find its $y$-coordinate?\n3. Triangle $POD$ is a right triangle with legs of length $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. How do we know that angle $POD$ is $45^\\circ$?\n4. How do we know that triangle $POD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle? What are the ratios of its side lengths?\n5. Why is the $y$-coordinate of point $P$ equal to $\\sin 315^\\circ$?\n6. Can we use a similar method to find $\\cos 315^\\circ$? How would we go about doing that?"
