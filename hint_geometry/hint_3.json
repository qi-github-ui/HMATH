    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of degrees in $\\angle ABC$. Since $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles with $AC=BC$, we have $\\angle BAC=\\angle ABC$.\n\nSo, the three interior angles of $\\triangle ABC$ measure $x^\\circ$, $x^\\circ$, and $40^\\circ$. The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so we have $$x+x+40 = 180,$$which we can solve to obtain $x=70$. Finally, $\\angle CBD$ is supplementary to angle $\\angle ABC$, so \\begin{align*}\nm\\angle CBD &= 180^\\circ - m\\angle ABC \\\\\n&= 180^\\circ - 70^\\circ \\\\\n&= \\boxed{110}^\\circ.\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step to solve this geometry problem?\n2. How do you know that there are different methods to use when solving this type of problem?\n3. If you choose to use the fact that $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, how can you use that information to find the measure of angle $\\angle ABC$?\n4. Why is the sum of the angles in a triangle always equal to 180 degrees? Can you explain the reasoning behind it?\n5. What is the relationship between angle $\\angle ABC$ and angle $\\angle CBD$? How can you use that relationship to find the measure of angle $\\angle CBD$?\n6. Can you think of any other types of geometry problems where similar thinking and steps may be used?"
