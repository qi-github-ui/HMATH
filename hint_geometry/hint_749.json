    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with angle $B$ congruent to angle $C$. The measure of angle $C$ is four times the measure of angle $A$. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $B$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the number of degrees in $\\angle A$. Then $\\angle C=4x^\\circ$, and $\\angle B$ is also $4x^\\circ$ (since $\\angle B$ is congruent to $\\angle C$).\n\nSince the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we have $$x + 4x + 4x = 180,$$ which we can solve for $x=20$. Therefore, $\\angle B = 4\\cdot 20 = \\boxed{80}$ degrees.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the given information about the triangle in your own words?\n2. What do we know about the relationship between angle B and angle C?\n3. Can you express the measure of angle C in terms of angle A using a variable?\n4. How can we use the sum of angles in a triangle to relate angles A, B, and C?\n5. What does the equation x + 4x + 4x = 180 represent? How can we solve it?\n6. What is the value of angle B that you obtained? Can you explain your reasoning behind it?"
