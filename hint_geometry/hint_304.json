    "solution": "Let $O$ be the center of the circle, and $r$ its radius, and let $X'$ and $Y'$ be the points diametrically opposite $X$ and $Y$, respectively. We have $OX' = OY' = r$, and $\\angle X'OY' = 90^\\circ$. Since triangles $X'OY'$ and $BAC$ are similar, we see that $AB = AC$. Let $X''$ be the foot of the altitude from $Y'$ to $\\overline{AB}$. Since $X''BY'$ is similar to $ABC$, and $X''Y' = r$, we have $X''B = r$. It follows that $AB = 3r$, so $r = 2$.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport olympiad;\nimport math;\nimport graph;\n\nunitsize(4cm);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = A + right;\npair C = A + up;\n\npair O = (1/3, 1/3);\n\npair Xprime = (1/3,2/3);\npair Yprime = (2/3,1/3);\n\nfill(Arc(O,1/3,0,90)--Xprime--Yprime--cycle,0.7*white);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(Circle(O, 1/3));\ndraw((0,1/3)--(2/3,1/3));\ndraw((1/3,0)--(1/3,2/3));\n\ndraw((2/3, 0)--(2/3, 1/3));\ndraw((1/16,0)--(1/16,1/16)--(0,1/16));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B, down);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C, left);\nlabel(\"$X$\",(1/3,0), down);\nlabel(\"$Y$\",(0,1/3), left);\nlabel(\"$X'$\", (1/3, 2/3), NE);\nlabel(\"$Y'$\", (2/3, 1/3), NE);\nlabel(\"$X''$\", (2/3, 0), down);\nlabel(\"$O$\", O, NE);\n\n[/asy]\n\nThen, the desired area is the area of the quarter circle minus that of the triangle $X'OY'$. And the answer is $\\frac 1 4 \\pi r^2 - \\frac 1 2 r^2 = \\boxed{\\pi - 2}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What do we know about the triangle $ABC$? Can you describe its properties and any given information?\n2. Can you identify any relationships between the triangle and the circle? What are the points of tangency and what do they mean?\n3. What can we learn from the fact that the diametrically opposite points of $X$ and $Y$ lie on side $BC$?\n4. How can we determine the length of $AB$ based on the given information and the relationships we discussed?\n5. What is the relationship between the radius of the circle and the length of $AB$? Can we calculate the radius using this information?\n6. Now that we know the radius of the circle, how can we find the area of the portion of the circle that lies outside the triangle?\n7. Can you calculate the final result for the area?"
