Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$, so $\\tan 120^\\circ =\\frac{\\sin 120^\\circ}{\\cos 120^\\circ} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}/2}{-1/2} = \\boxed{-\\sqrt{3}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of the unit circle, and how is it related to angles in trigonometry?\n2. Why is $120^\\circ$ used in this problem, and what significance does it have in trigonometry?\n3. How do we find the coordinates of point $P$ using the given information about the angle and the unit circle?\n4. What is the relationship between the angle and the coordinates of $P$? How does this help us find the value of $\\tan 120^\\circ$?\n5. What is the ratio definition of $\\tan$ in trigonometry, and how does it relate to the values of $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ at a given angle?\n6. How does the information about the 30-60-90 triangle in the problem relate to the value of $\\tan 120^\\circ$? Can you explain this relationship in detail?\n7. Can you think of other problems or real-life situations where understanding trigonometry and the concept of unit circle could be useful?"
