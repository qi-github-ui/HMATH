    "solution": "The perimeter of the shaded region equals the sum of the lengths of $OP$ and $OQ$ plus the length of arc $PQ$.\n\nEach of $OP$ and $OQ$ has length 5.\n\nArc $PQ$ forms $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the circle with center $O$ and radius 5, because the missing portion corresponds to a central angle of $90^\\circ$, and so is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the total circle.\n\nThus, the length of arc $PQ$ is $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the circumference of this circle, or $\\frac{3}{4}(2\\pi(5))=\\frac{15}{2}\\pi$. Therefore, the perimeter is $5+5+\\frac{15}{2}\\pi = \\boxed{10 + \\frac{15}{2}\\pi}$.",
