    "problem": "What is the minimum number of equilateral triangles, of side length 1 unit, needed to cover an equilateral triangle of side length 10 units?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The ratio of the sides of the small to big equilateral triangle (note that they are similar) is $1/10$, so the ratio of their areas is $(1/10)^2 = 1/100$. So the big equilateral triangle has 100 times the area of a small one, so it will take $\\boxed{100}$ small triangles to cover the big one.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given problem asking us to find out?\n2. Can you describe what an equilateral triangle is?\n3. How can we find the ratio of the sides between the small and big equilateral triangles?\n4. How can we use the ratio of sides to find the ratio of areas between the small and big equilateral triangles?\n5. What does it mean if the big equilateral triangle has 100 times the area of a small one?\n6. How can we use the ratio of areas to determine the number of small equilateral triangles needed to cover the big one?\n7. Are there any assumptions being made when we say that the small equilateral triangles can perfectly cover the big one?\n8. Can you think of any other geometry problems where ratios can be used to solve them?"
