Therefore, we have \\[\\frac{[EDC]}{[EAB]} = \\left(\\frac{17}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{289}{64}.\\]  Since $[EDC] = [EAB] + [ABCD]$, we have $\\frac{[ABCD] + [EAB]}{[EAB]} = \\frac{289}{64}$, so \\[\\frac{[ABCD]}{[EAB]} + 1 = \\frac{289}{64}.\\] Therefore, $\\frac{[ABCD]}{[EAB]} = \\frac{225}{64}$, so $\\frac{[EAB]}{[ABCD]} = \\boxed{\\frac{64}{225}}$.",

How can that information be used to find the ratio of the area of triangle EAB to the area of trapezoid ABCD?\n3. Can you explain why triangles EAB and EDC are similar? What does this similarity imply about their corresponding sides?\n4. Given that the ratio of the corresponding sides of the similar triangles is 17/8, how can we use this information to find the ratio of the areas of EAB and EDC?\n5. How can we express the ratio of the areas of EAB and EDC using the given information? What is the value of this ratio?\n6. How does the fact that the area of EDC is the sum of the areas of EAB and ABCD help us in finding the ratio of the areas of EAB and ABCD?\n7. Can you determine the ratio of the areas of ABCD and EAB using the equation derived from the previous question? What is the value of this ratio?"
