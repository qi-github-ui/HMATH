    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=10$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{10\\cdot 3\\cdot 3\\cdot 4} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 10,$$ which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{5}}$.",
