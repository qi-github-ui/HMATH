    "solution": "The sides of the triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality, so $AB + AC > BC$, $AB + BC > AC$, and $AC + BC > AB$.  Substituting the side lengths, these inequalities turn into \\begin{align*}\n(x + 4) + (3x) &> x + 9, \\\\\n(x + 4) + (x + 9) &> 3x, \\\\\n(3x) + (x + 9) &> x + 4,\n\\end{align*} which give us $x > 5/3$, $x < 13$, and $x > -5/3$, respectively.\n\nHowever, we also want $\\angle A$ to be the largest angle, which means that $BC > AB$ and $BC > AC$.  These inequalities turn into $x + 9 > x + 4$ (which is always satisfied), and $x + 9 > 3x$, which gives us $x < 9/2$.\n\nHence, $x$ must satisfy $x > 5/3$, $x < 13$, $x > -5/3$, and $x < 9/2$, which means \\[\\frac{5}{3} < x < \\frac{9}{2}.\\] The answer is $9/2 - 5/3 = \\boxed{\\frac{17}{6}}$.\n\n(Also, note that every value of $x$ in this interval makes all the side lengths positive.)",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the triangle inequality and how it pertains to the given triangle?\n2. What do the inequalities $x + 4 + 3x > x + 9$, $x + 4 + x + 9 > 3x$, and $3x + x + 9 > x + 4$ represent?\n3. Why must these inequalities hold in order for $\\angle A$ to be the largest angle?\n4. How can we interpret the inequality $x + 9 > x + 4$ in the context of the triangle?\n5. What is the range of possible values for $x$ that satisfy all the given inequalities?\n6. How can we use this range of values to determine the least possible value of $n-m$?"
