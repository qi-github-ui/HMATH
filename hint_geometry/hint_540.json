    "solution": "Since $\\angle C = 45^\\circ$, triangle $ACD$ is a $45^\\circ$-$45^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, which means $AD = CD = AC/\\sqrt{2} = 3$.  Then $BD = BC - CD = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, H;\n\nA = (1,3);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (4,0);\nD = (A + reflect(B,C)*(A))/2;\nE = (B + reflect(C,A)*(B))/2;\nF = (C + reflect(A,B)*(C))/2;\nH = extension(B,E,C,F);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"$H$\", H, SE);\n[/asy]\n\nAlso, $\\angle EBC = 90^\\circ - \\angle BCE = 45^\\circ$, so triangle $BHD$ is a $45^\\circ$-$45^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle.

What is the relationship between HD and BD? How does this relationship help us in finding the length of HD?\n6. How do we find the length of AH using the lengths of AD and HD? Is there any other information or concept we need to consider?\n7. Can you think of any other triangle or situation where we can use similar reasoning or steps to find the ratio of lengths like AH:HD?"
