The area of each square is 16, so the side length of each square is $\\sqrt{16} = 4$.\n\nThen $DE = 4$ and $HE = EF/2 = 4/2 = 2$, so the area of triangle $DEH$ is $DE \\cdot EH/2 = 4 \\cdot 2/2 = 4$.  By symmetry, the area of triangle $CDH$ is also 4, so the area of quadrilateral $CDEH$ is $4 + 4 = 8$.\n\nThen the area of pentagon $ADEHB$ is $16 - 8 = 8$, and the area of pentagon $CDGFH$ is also $16 - 8 = 8$.  Hence, the area of polygon $ABHFGD$ is $8 + 8 + 8 = \\boxed{24}$.",
