    "solution": "We first notice that the vertical and horizontal distances between the two points are both $4$, so the slope of the line which the two points are on must be $1$. We now find the length of the legs of the triangle. Since the slope of the line is one, we can add $2$ to both the $x$ and $y$-coordinates of $(-2,6)$ and get that the line passes through $(0,8)$. Similarly, we can subtract $2$ from the $x$ and $y$-coordinates of $(-6,2)$ to find that it passes through $(-8,0)$. We now have a right triangle with legs of length $8$, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2}bh=\\frac{1}{2}(8)(8)=\\boxed{32}$ square units.",
