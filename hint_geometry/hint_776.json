Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFM$ is a right triangle.  We are given $PF = 12$, and we have $FM = (1/2)(AB) = 5$, so the Pythagorean Theorem gives us $PM = \\sqrt{PF^2 + FM^2} = 13$.  Therefore, since the four lateral faces are congruent triangles, the total surface area of the pyramid is \\[[ABCD] + 4[PAB] = 10^2 + 4(13)(10)/2 = \\boxed{360}\\text{ square centimeters}.\\]",

What is the relationship between PF and FM in triangle PFM?\n4. What theorem can we use to find PM?\n5. How can we find the total surface area of the pyramid using the lengths of AB, PF, and PM? \n6. Why do we multiply the area of the base by 4 when calculating the total surface area?\n7. Can you think of any other formulas or relationships that could be applied to find the surface area of a pyramid?\n8. How does the height of the pyramid affect the total surface area?"
