    "problem": "Through a point on the hypotenuse of a right triangle, lines are drawn parallel to the legs of the triangle so that the triangle is divided into a square and two smaller right triangles. The area of one of the two small right triangles is $m$ times the area of the square. What is the ratio of the area of the other small right triangle to the area of the square?  Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $m$.",

    "solution": "Without loss of generality, let the side of the square have length 1 unit and let the area of triangle $ADF$ be $m$. Let $AD=r$ and $EC=s$. Because triangles $ADF$ and $FEC$ are similar, $\\frac{s}{1}=\\frac{1}{r}$. Since $\\frac{1}{2}r=m$, the area of triangle $FEC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}s=\\frac{1}{2r}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4m}}$.

    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the given problem and draw a diagram?\n2. How did you decide to assume the length of the square to be 1 unit? Is this assumption necessary?\n3. How do you know that triangles $ADF$ and $FEC$ are similar?\n4. How did you derive the equation $\\frac{s}{1}=\\frac{1}{r}$? Is this equation specific to this problem or can it be applied more generally?\n5. Given that $\\frac{1}{2}r=m$, how did you determine the area of triangle $FEC$ in terms of $m$? \n6. Is there another way to approach this problem besides assuming the side length of the square to be 1? \n7. Can you generalize your findings to a right triangle with legs of length $a$ and $b$, and a point on the hypotenuse that divides the triangle into a square and two smaller right triangles?"
