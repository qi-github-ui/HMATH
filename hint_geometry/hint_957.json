    "solution": "Since $\\angle A$ is inscribed in arc $KT$, the measure of arc $KT$ is $2\\angle A = 84^\\circ$.  Since arc $AKT$ is a semicircle, arc $KA$ has measure $180 - 84 = \\boxed{96}$ degrees.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information in the problem?\n2. What does the measure of angle KAT tell us about the corresponding arc?\n3. How can we determine the measure of arc KT using the given angle?\n4. How does the measure of arc KT help us find the measure of arc AK?\n5. What is the relationship between arc AK and the semicircle in this figure?\n6. How can we find the measure of arc AK using the information about the semicircle?\n7. Can you calculate the measure of arc AK using the given information?"
