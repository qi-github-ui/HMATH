How can you determine the circumference of the base of the resulting cone?\n4. Can you explain the relationship between the angle measure of the cut-out section and the ratio of the circumferences?\n5. Can you calculate the circumference of the entire circle and use it to find the circumference of the base of the cone?\n6. Are there any other ways to find the circumference of the base of the cone using the given information?\n7. How can you express the circumference of the base of the cone in terms of $\\pi$?\n8. Can you generalize this problem to other cases where a section is cut out from a circle?"
