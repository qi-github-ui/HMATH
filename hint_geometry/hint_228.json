    "solution": "Let $O$ denote the origin, $P$ the center of the circle, and $r$ the radius. A radius from the center to the point of tangency with the line $y = x$ forms a right triangle with hypotenuse $\\overline{OP}$. This  right  triangle is isosceles since the line $y=x$ forms a $45^\\circ$ angle with the $y$-axis. So \\[r\\sqrt{2}=r+6\\]and \\[r=\\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2}-1}=\\boxed{6\\sqrt{2}+6}.\\][asy]\nunitsize(0.2cm);\npair P,O;\nO=(0,0);\nP=(0,20.4);\ndraw(Circle(P,14.4),linewidth(0.7));\ndot(P);\ndot(O);\ndraw((-15,0)--(15,0),Arrow);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(15,0),S);\ndraw((0,-0.2)--(0,30),Arrow);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,30),E);\ndraw((-14,6)--(12,6),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$y=6$\",(12,6),E);\ndraw((-1,-1)--(17,17),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$y=x$\",(17,17),NE);\nlabel(\"$y=-x$\",(-17,17),NW);\ndraw((1,-1)--(-17,17),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,S);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,W);\ndraw(P--(10.2,10.2),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$r$\",(5.1,15.3),N);\n[/asy]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the situation described in the problem using your own words?\n2. What is the significance of the circle having its center at $(0, k)$ with $k > 6$?\n3. Based on the given information, what do you think is the relationship between the radius of the circle and the lines $y = x$, $y = -x$, and $y = 6$?\n4. How can we use the fact that the line $y = x$ forms a $45^\\circ$ angle with the $y$-axis to help us find the radius of the circle?\n5. Can you analyze the triangle formed by the radius, the line $y = x$, and the $y$-axis? What information do we have about this triangle and how can we use it to solve the problem?\n6. What does it mean for the triangle to be isosceles and how does that relate to the equation $r\\sqrt{2} = r + 6$?\n7. How can we solve the equation $r\\sqrt{2} = r + 6$ to find the value of $r$?\n8. Can you simplify the expression $\\frac{6}{\\sqrt{2} - 1}$ to determine the radius of the circle?"
