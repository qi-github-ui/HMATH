    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the Pythagorean Theorem and how is it used to solve for sides in right triangles?\n2. Can you explain how we found the length of side AC using the Pythagorean Theorem in this specific triangle? \n3. How does the cosine function relate to the sides of a right triangle? \n4. Can you determine which angle in the triangle corresponds to angle C and why? \n5. How does the value of cosine change as the angle C varies in this triangle? \n6. Can you think of other applications of the Pythagorean Theorem and cosine function in geometry or other fields?"
