    "solution": "By the Pythagorean Theorem, \\begin{align*}\nYZ^2 &= YX^2 + XZ^2 \\\\\n&= 60^2+80^2 \\\\\n&= 3600+6400 \\\\\n&=10000,\n\\end{align*} so $YZ=100.$\n\n(We could also have found $YZ$ without using the Pythagorean Theorem by noticing that $\\triangle XYZ$ is a right-angled triangle with its right-angle at $X$ and $XY=60=3\\cdot 20$ and $XZ=80=4\\cdot 20.$ This means that $\\triangle XYZ$ is similar to a 3-4-5 triangle, and so $YZ=5\\cdot 20=100.$)\n\nSince $\\triangle YXZ$ is right-angled at $X,$ its area is $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 60\\cdot 80=2400.$$ Since $XW$ is perpendicular to $YZ,$ then the area of $\\triangle YXZ$ is also equal to $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 100\\cdot XW=50XW.$$ Therefore, $50XW=2400,$ so $XW=48.$ By the Pythagorean Theorem, \\begin{align*}\nWZ^2 &= 80^2 - 48^2 \\\\\n&= 6400 - 2304 \\\\\n&= 4096.\n\\end{align*} Thus, $WZ = \\sqrt{4096}=\\boxed{64}.$\n\nAn alternative solution comes by noticing that $\\triangle XZW$ and $\\triangle YZX$ are similar. Therefore \\[\\frac{WZ}{XZ}=\\frac{XZ}{YZ}\\] or \\[\\frac{WZ}{80}=\\frac{80}{100}=\\frac45.\\] This tells us that  \\[WZ=\\frac45\\cdot80=\\boxed{64}.\\]",
