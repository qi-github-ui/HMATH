    "problem": "A wooden model of a square pyramid has a base edge of 12 cm and an altitude of 8 cm. A cut is made parallel to the base of the pyramid that separates it into two pieces: a smaller pyramid and a frustum. Each base edge of the smaller pyramid is 6 cm and its altitude is 4 cm. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of the frustum?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The piece that is removed from the original pyramid to create the frustum is itself a square pyramid that is similar to the original pyramid.  The ratio of corresponding side lengths is 1/2, so the piece that was removed has volume $(1/2)^3 = 1/8$ of the volume of the original pyramid.  Therefore, the remaining frustum has volume $1-(1/8) = {7/8}$ of the original pyramid.\n\nThe original pyramid has base area $12^2 = 144$ square cm, so its volume is $144\\cdot 8/3 = 48\\cdot 8$ cubic centimeters.  Therefore, the frustum has volume \\[\\frac{7}{8}\\cdot (48\\cdot 8) = 48\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{336}\\text{ cubic centimeters}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the shape and dimensions of the original square pyramid? \n2. What does the term \"frustum\" mean in geometry and how is it related to the original pyramid? \n3. What is the formula for the volume of a pyramid and how can it be applied to find the volume of the original pyramid? \n4. How can we find the volume of the smaller pyramid that was cut from the original pyramid? \n5. What is the relationship between the volume of the frustum and the volumes of the original and smaller pyramids? \n6. How can we use the given information about the dimensions of the original pyramid and the smaller pyramid to find the volume of the frustum? \n7. Are there any other methods or formulas that can be used to find the volume of a frustum? \n8. How can we check our answer and ensure that it is correct?"
