    "solution": "Draw a 4 by 8 rectangle with the vertices at $(4, 4), (12, 4), (12, 0)$ and $(4, 0)$. The area of that box is $4 \\times 8 = 32$ square units. From that we can subtract the area of the sectors of the 2 circles that are binding our shaded region. The area of each sector is $(1/4)4^2\\pi = 4\\pi$; therefore, we need to subtract $2(4\\pi) = 8\\pi$. This gives us $\\boxed{32 - 8\\pi}$ square units.",
