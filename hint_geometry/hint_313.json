(This is because each diameter is perpendicular to the common tangent at the point of contact.)\n\nSince $AO$ is a radius of the larger circle, it is a diameter of the smaller circle.\n\nSince the radius of the larger circle is $6,$ the diameter of the smaller circle is $6,$ so the radius of the smaller circle on the left is $3.$\n\nSimilarly, we can draw a radius through $O$ and $B$ and deduce that the radius of the smaller circle on the right is also $3.$ The area of the shaded region equals the area of the larger circle minus the combined area of the two smaller circles. Thus, the area of the shaded region is $$6^2\\pi - 3^2\\pi - 3^2\\pi = 36\\pi - 9\\pi - 9\\pi = \\boxed{18\\pi}.$$",
