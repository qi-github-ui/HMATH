    "solution": "We first observe that by the Pythagorean theorem $\\triangle PBC$ must be a right triangle with right angle at $P$, since $PB=3$, $PC=4$, and $BC=5$.\n\n$[\\triangle PBC]=\\frac{1}{2}(3)(4) = 6=\\frac{1}{2}(PH)(5)$. Hence, the altitude $\\overline{PH}$ from $P$ to $\\overline{BC}$ has length $\\frac{12}{5}$. Let $h$ be the length of the altitude from $A$ to $\\overline{BC}$. Then $[\\triangle ABC] = \\frac{1}{2}(h)(5)$, so the area is maximized when $A$ is most high above $\\overline {BC}$. Since $AP=2$, maximization occurs when $A$ is directly over $P$, leading to a height of $h=\\frac{12}{5}+2=\\frac{22}{5}$. In this case, \\[[\\triangle ABC] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{22}{5} \\right)(5)=\\boxed{11}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the Pythagorean theorem, and how is it applicable in this problem?\n2. How do we know that $\\triangle PBC$ is a right triangle with right angle at $P$?\n3. Can you explain why $[\\triangle PBC]=\\frac{1}{2}(3)(4)$, and how this relates to the altitude $\\overline{PH}$?\n4. How do we find the altitude from $A$ to $\\overline{BC}$, and why is it necessary to maximize this height in order to maximize the area of $\\triangle ABC$?\n5. How do we determine where to place point $A$ in order to achieve the maximum height and area?\n6. If we were given different side lengths for the triangle, would the same approach apply? What aspects of the problem would need to be reconsidered or modified?"
