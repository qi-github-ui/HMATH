    "solution": "Since $JM$ bisects $\\angle J$, we know that the measure of $\\angle KJM$ is $60/2 = 30$ degrees. Similarly, since $MK$ bisects $\\angle K$, we know that the measure of $\\angle JKM$ is $30/2 = 15$ degrees. Finally, since the sum of the measures of the angles of a triangle always equals $180$ degrees, we know that the sum of the measures of $\\angle JKM$, $\\angle KJM$, and $\\angle JMK$ equals $180$ degrees. Thus, the measure of $\\angle JMK = 180 - 30 - 15 = \\boxed{135}$ degrees.",
