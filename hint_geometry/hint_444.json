    "solution": "Since $AB\\parallel EF,$ we know that $\\angle BAC = \\angle FEC$ and $\\angle ABC = \\angle EFC.$ Therefore, we see that $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle EFC$ by AA Similarity. Likewise, $\\triangle BDC \\sim \\triangle BEF.$\n\nFrom our similarities, we can come up with two equations: $\\dfrac{BF}{BC} = \\dfrac{EF}{DC}$ and $\\dfrac{FC}{BC} = \\dfrac{EF}{AB}.$\n\nSince we have $AB$ and $DC$ and we want to find $EF,$ we want all the other quantities to disappear. Since $BF + FC = BC,$ we try adding our two equations: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{BF}{BC} + \\frac{FC}{BC} &= \\frac{EF}{DC} + \\frac{EF}{AB}.\\\\\n\\frac{BC}{BC} = 1 &= EF\\left(\\frac{1}{DC} + \\frac{1}{AB}\\right)\\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{DC} + \\frac{1}{AB}} &= EF\n\\end{align*} Now we plug in $DC = 100\\text{ cm}$ and $AB = 150\\text{ cm},$ giving us $EF = \\boxed{60}\\text{ cm}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What do we know about the relationship between $AB,$ $CD,$ and $EF$ based on the diagram?\n2. How do the angles $\\angle BAC$ and $\\angle FEC$ relate to each other? What about $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle EFC$?\n3. What is the similarity ratio between $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle EFC$? What about between $\\triangle BDC$ and $\\triangle BEF$?\n4. Can you write down two equations involving $EF,$ $AB,$ $BC,$ $DC,$ $BF,$ and $FC$ based on the similarities? How do we use these equations to find $EF$?\n5. Why did we add the two equations together? How did we solve for $EF$?\n6. If we changed the length of $AB$ and $DC,$ would the length of $EF$ change accordingly? Can you generalize your answer?"
