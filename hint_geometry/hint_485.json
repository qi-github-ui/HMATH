    "problem": "The midpoints of the sides of a triangle with area $T$ are joined to form a triangle with area $M$. What is the ratio of $M$ to $T$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "When you connect the midpoints of two sides of a triangle, you get a segment which is half as long as the third side of the triangle. Therefore, every side in the smaller triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}$ the side length of the original triangle. Therefore, the area of the smaller triangle is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$ the area of the larger triangle.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in finding the area of the triangle formed by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the original triangle?\n2. In finding the area of the smaller triangle, what relationship exists between the lengths of the sides of the smaller triangle and the original triangle?\n3. Why is the segment formed by connecting the midpoints of two sides of the triangle half as long as the third side of the triangle?\n4. How does the relationship between the lengths of the sides of the smaller triangle and the original triangle help us find the area of the smaller triangle?\n5. Based on the relationship between the lengths of the sides, what is the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the original triangle?\n6. Can you think of any other situations where a similar approach is used to find the ratio of areas in geometry problems?"
