    "solution": "We will also adopt the notation $|\\triangle XYZ|$ to represent the area of $\\triangle XYZ$.\n\nRecall that if two triangles have their bases along the same straight line and they share a common vertex that is not on this line, then the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of the lengths of their bases.\n\nUsing this fact, $$\\frac{|\\triangle AEF|}{|\\triangle DEF|}=\\frac{AF}{FD}=\\frac{3}{1}.$$Thus, $$|\\triangle AEF|=3\\times |\\triangle DEF|=3(17)=51.$$Then, $$|\\triangle AED|=|\\triangle AEF|+|\\triangle DEF|=51+17=68.$$Also, $$\\frac{|\\triangle ECD|}{|\\triangle AED|}=\\frac{EC}{AE}=\\frac{2}{1}.$$Thus, $$|\\triangle ECD|=2\\times |\\triangle AED|=2(68)=136.$$Then, $$|\\triangle DCA|=|\\triangle ECD|+|\\triangle AED|=136+68=204.$$Since $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $$\\frac{|\\triangle BDA|}{|\\triangle DCA|}=\\frac{BD}{DC}=\\frac{1}{1}.$$Then, $|\\triangle BDA|=|\\triangle DCA|=204$ and $$|\\triangle ABC|=|\\triangle BDA|+|\\triangle DCA|=204+204=\\boxed{408}.$$",
