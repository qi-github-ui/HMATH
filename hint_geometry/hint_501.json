    "solution": "An angle with measure $50\\%$ larger than the measure of a right angle has measure $\\frac{3}{2}\\cdot 90^{\\circ}=135^{\\circ}$.\n\nThus the other two angles have a combined measure of $45^{\\circ}$. Each one has a measure of\n\n$$\\frac{45^{\\circ}}{2}=\\boxed{22.5^{\\circ}}.$$",
