    "problem": "What is the area, in square units, of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle whose area is $324\\pi$ square units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Note that since the area is $\\pi r^2 = 324 \\pi$, where $r$ is the radius, we must have $r=\\sqrt{324}=18$. Thus the distance from the center of the hexagon to a vertex is $18$, and we can break up the hexagon into $6$ equilateral triangles, each of which has side length $18$. The area of an equilateral triangle of side length $s$ is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$, so the area of each equilateral triangle is $81 \\sqrt{3}$, making the total $6(81 \\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{486 \\sqrt{3}}$.",
