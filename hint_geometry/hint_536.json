    "solution": "First of all, for our benefit, we should draw in the desired angle: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pD, pE;\npA = (0, 0);\npB = pA + dir(300);\npC = pA + dir(240);\npD = pC + dir(270);\npE = pB + dir(270);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pB--pC--pD--pE--pB);\ndraw(pD--pA--pE, red);\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, E);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, W);\nlabel(\"$D$\", pD, SW);\nlabel(\"$E$\", pE, SE);\n[/asy] We can see that $AB = BC = EB,$ thus $\\triangle ABE$ is an isosceles triangle, where $\\angle ABE = 90^\\circ + 60^\\circ = 150^\\circ.$ Since the other two angles are equal and add up to $30^\\circ$, we have that $\\angle BAE = 15^\\circ.$ Likewise, $\\angle CAD = 15^\\circ.$\n\nThen, $\\angle DAE = \\angle CAB - \\angle CAD - \\angle BAE = 60^\\circ - 15^\\circ - 15^\\circ = \\boxed{30^\\circ.}$",

What do we know about equilateral triangles? How can that help us in this problem?\n4. What do we know about squares and their angles? How can that help us in this problem?\n5. Can you explain why angle ABE is 150 degrees? How does that relate to angle DAE?\n6. Can you explain why angle CAB is 60 degrees? How does that relate to angle DAE?\n7. Can you explain why angle BAE and angle CAD are both 15 degrees?\n8. What is the relationship between angle BAE and angle CAD?\n9. How can we use the angles we have determined to find the measure of angle DAE?\n10. Can you come up with a general conclusion about the measure of angle DAE in this scenario?"
