    "solution": "Since $AB \\parallel YZ,$ we know that $\\angle A = \\angle Z$ and $\\angle B = \\angle Y.$ That works out nicely, since that means $\\triangle ABQ \\sim ZYQ.$ If $BQ = 12$ and $QY = 24,$ that means the ratio of sides in $ABQ$ to $ZYQ$ is $1:2.$\n\nSince $AZ = 42 = AQ + QZ$ and $AQ = \\dfrac{QZ}{2},$ that means $\\dfrac{3 \\cdot QZ}{2} = 42$ and thus $QZ = \\boxed{28}.$",
