    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ with vertices $A(-2, 0)$, $B(1, 4)$ and $C(-3, 2)$ is reflected over the $y$-axis to form triangle $A'B'C'$. What is the length of a segment drawn from $C$ to $C'$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Reflecting a point over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coordinate.  So if $C$ is $(-3,2)$, $C'$ will be $(3,2)$.  The segment is a horizontal line of length $3+3=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the process of reflecting a point over the y-axis?\n2. What are the coordinates of C and C'?\n3. How do we find the length of the segment from C to C'? \n4. Can you explain why the segment is a horizontal line?\n5. What is the length of the segment from C to C'?"
