    "problem": "What is the area, in square units, of a triangle whose vertices are at $(4, -1)$, $(10, 3)$ and $(4, 5)$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Notice how two of the points, $(4,-1)$ and $(4,5)$, lie on the same line parallel through the $y$-axis with $x$-intercept $(4,0)$.  Let these points lie on the base of the triangle, so the base has length $5-(-1)=6$.  The height is the perpendicular distance from $(10,3)$ to this line, which is $10-4=6$.  The area is thus $\\frac{1}{2} (6)(6)=\\boxed{18}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe how to find the area of a triangle using the given coordinates of its vertices?\n2. How do the points (4, -1) and (4, 5) play a role in determining the base of the triangle?\n3. Why is the length of the base of the triangle equal to the difference between the y-coordinates of the two points (4, -1) and (4, 5)?\n4. What is the significance of the points (10, 3) and (4, 5)? How do they contribute to finding the height of the triangle?\n5. How can you find the perpendicular distance from the point (10, 3) to the line formed by the points (4, -1) and (4, 5)?\n6. What formula can you use to calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height?\n7. Can you calculate the area of the triangle using the formula discussed above?"
