    "problem": "A cone is inverted and filled with water to 3/4 of its height.  What percent of the cone's volume is filled with water?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest ten-thousandth.  (You should enter 10.0000 for $10\\%$ instead of 0.1000.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the cone have height $h$ and radius $r$, so its volume is \\[\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2h.\\]When the cone is filled with water, the amount of water in the cone forms a smaller cone that is similar to the original cone.  This smaller cone has height $\\frac{3}{4}h$, and by similar triangles, radius $\\frac{3}{4}r$.  So, the smaller cone has volume \\[\\frac{1}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{3}{4}r\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}h\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi \\cdot \\frac{3^3}{4^3} r^2h.\\]Hence the ratio of the volume of the water-filled cone to the original cone is \\[\\frac{3^3}{4^3}=\\frac{27}{64}=0.421875,\\]which, as a percentage, is $\\boxed{42.1875}\\%$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the shape and properties of a cone?\n2. How is the volume of a cone calculated? Can you derive the formula from scratch?\n3. What does it mean for the cone to be filled to 3/4 of its height with water? Can you visualize this?\n4. How does the amount of water in the cone relate to the volume of the cone? Can you express this as a ratio?\n5. How do we determine the volume of the smaller cone formed by the water in the larger cone? Can you explain the reasoning behind this?\n6. How does the ratio of the volume of the water-filled cone to the original cone give us the percentage of the cone filled with water? Why is this ratio equal to (27/64) or 42.1875%?"
