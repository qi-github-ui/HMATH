    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The slant height of the cone is equal to the radius of the sector, or $10$.  The circumference of the base of the cone is equal to the length of the sector's arc, or $\\frac{252^\\circ}{360^\\circ}(20\\pi) = 14\\pi$.  The radius of a circle with circumference $14\\pi$ is $7$.  Hence the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
