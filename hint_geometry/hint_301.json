    "solution": "Imagine the square whose diagonal would be PQ.  Clearly, that square would be formed of 9 of the shaded squares.  The formula for the area of a square from its diagonal is $A = \\frac{d^2}{2}$, therefore, the area of that imaginary square is 18.  Thus, each smaller shaded square has area 2, making for a total of $\\boxed{32\\text{ square cm}}$ for the entire shaded area.",
