    "problem": "How many cubic feet are in the volume of a round swimming pool which is 16 feet in diameter and 4 feet deep throughout? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The radius of this pool is $16/2=8$ feet; the volume of this pool is thus $\\pi(8^2)(4)=\\boxed{256\\pi}$ cubic feet.",
