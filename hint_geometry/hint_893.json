    "solution": "In 30 minutes, the tip of the second hand travels 30 times around the circumference of a circle of radius 6cm. Since the circumference is $2\\pi \\cdot6 = 12\\pi$, the tip of the second hand travels $12\\pi \\cdot 30 = \\boxed{360\\pi}$ centimeters.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the length of the second hand in this clock?\n2. How many times does the second hand go around the clock in 30 minutes?\n3. What is the formula for the circumference of a circle?\n4. How do you calculate the length of the circumference using the given radius?\n5. What is the formula for calculating the distance traveled by the tip of the second hand?\n6. How can you express your answer in terms of $\\pi$?\n7. What is the final result?"
