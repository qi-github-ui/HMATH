    "solution": "At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the initial angle between the hour and minute hands when the clock shows 8:00?\n2. How much does the minute hand move each minute, and how much does the hour hand move each minute?\n3. What is the rate at which the angle between the hands decreases as time passes?\n4. After 15 minutes, what is the new angle between the hands?\n5. How do you find the smaller angle when there is more than a half revolution between the hands?\n6. Is there a formula or method that can be used to find the angle between the hands at any time on a clock?"
