    "problem": "What is the volume, in cubic inches, of a rectangular box, whose faces have areas of $24$ square inches, $16$ square inches and $6$ square inches?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular box, we look for the volume $lwh$. We arbitrarily set $lw=24$, $wh=16$, and $lh=6$. Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=24\\cdot16\\cdot6=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot2^4\\cdot2\\cdot3=2^8\\cdot3^2$. To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^4\\cdot3=\\boxed{48}$ cubic inches.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the dimensions of the rectangular box that we are dealing with?\n2. How did we arrive at the equations $lw=24$, $wh=16$, and $lh=6$?\n3. Why did we choose to multiply all three equations together?\n4. What does the equation $l^2w^2h^2=2^8\\cdot3^2$ represent?\n5. Why did we take the square root of both sides of the equation $l^2w^2h^2=2^8\\cdot3^2$?\n6. What is the final volume of the rectangular box, and how did we arrive at that answer?"
