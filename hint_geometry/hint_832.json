Then segment $AC$ has length $2r$. Recall that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it cuts. Because $AC$ is a diameter of the circle, arcs $ADC$ and $ABC$ both have measure 180 degrees. Thus, angles $D$ and $B$ have measure half that, or 90 degrees. Thus, they are both right angles. Now we know that triangle $ADC$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle and that triangle $ABC$ is a 45-45-90 right triangle.\n\nWe can use the ratios of the sides in these special triangles to determine that  \\begin{align*}\nCD&=\\frac{AC}{2}=\\frac{2r}{2}=r \\\\\nAD&=DC\\sqrt{3}=r\\sqrt{3} \\\\\nAB&=\\frac{AC}{\\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{2}}=r\\sqrt{2} \\\\\nBC&=AB=r\\sqrt{2}.\n\\end{align*}Now we can find the areas of triangles $ADC$ and $ABC$. \\begin{align*}\nA_{ADC}&=\\frac{1}{2}(r)(r\\sqrt{3})=\\frac{r^2\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\\nA_{ABC} &=\\frac{1}{2}(r\\sqrt{2})(r\\sqrt{2})=\\frac{1}{2}(2r^2)=r^2.\n\\end{align*}Thus, the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of triangles $ADC$ and $ABC$. \\[A_{ABCD}=\\frac{r^2\\sqrt{3}}{2} + r^2=r^2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}+1\\right)=r^2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+2}{2}\\right).\\]The area of the circle is $\\pi r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of $ABCD$ to the area of the circle is \\[\\frac{r^2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+2}{2}\\right)}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{\\cancel{r^2}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+2}{2}\\right)}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}+2}{2\\pi}.\\]Thus, $a=2$, $b=3$, and $c=2$. Finally, we find $a+b+c=2+3+2=\\boxed{7}$.",
