    "problem": "The lengths of the sides of a non-degenerate triangle are $x$, 13 and 37 units. How many integer values of $x$ are possible?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "By the triangle inequality, \\begin{align*}\nx + 13 &> 37, \\\\\nx + 37 &> 13, \\\\\n13 + 37 &> x,\n\\end{align*} which tell us that $x > 24$, $x > -24$, and $x < 50$.  Hence, the possible values of $x$ are $25, 26, \\dots, 49$, for a total of $49 - 25 + 1 = \\boxed{25}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the Triangle Inequality? Why is it important when considering the lengths of a triangle?\n2. What are the inequalities we can form based on the given side lengths of the triangle?\n3. What do these inequalities tell us about the possible range of values for x?\n4. Are there any other restrictions on the value of x, considering it represents the length of a side of a triangle?\n5. What is the range of values for x that satisfy all the inequalities and conditions of a non-degenerate triangle?\n6. How many integer values fall within this range?"
