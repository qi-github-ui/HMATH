    "problem": "A hemisphere-shaped bowl with radius 1 foot is filled full with chocolate.  All of the chocolate is then evenly distributed between 27 congruent, smaller hemisphere-shaped molds.  What is the radius of each of the smaller molds, in feet?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so a hemisphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$.  The large hemisphere-shaped bowl has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi(1^3) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ cubic feet.\n\nLet each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds have radius $r$.  Their total volume, in terms of $r$, is $27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$ cubic feet, so we have \\[27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi.\\]Dividing both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ yields $27r^3 =1$, so $r=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.",
