    "solution": "The circle with center $C$ is the incircle of $\\triangle PQR$. So, any segment from a vertex of the triangle to $C$ is an angle bisector.\n\nFrom $\\angle QRC = 30^\\circ$, we find that $\\angle QRP = 60^\\circ$ because $RC$ is an angle bisector.\n\nThe sum of the measures of the internal angles of a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\angle QPR &= 180^\\circ - \\angle PQR - \\angle QRP \\\\\n&= 180^\\circ - 65^\\circ - 60^\\circ.\n\\end{align*}This yields $\\angle QPR = \\boxed{55^\\circ}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How is the circle with center $C$ related to triangle $PQR$?\n2. Can you explain why any segment from a vertex of $PQR$ to $C$ is an angle bisector?\n3. How do we use the fact that $RC$ is an angle bisector to find $\\angle QRP$?\n4. What is the sum of the measures of the internal angles of triangle $PQR$?\n5. Can you explain why we subtract the measures of $\\angle PQR$ and $\\angle QRP$ from $180^\\circ$ to find $\\angle QPR$?\n6. Are there other relationships or formulas involving the measures of angles in a triangle that we can use in this problem?"
