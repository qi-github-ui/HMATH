    "problem": "The lengths of the three sides of a triangle are $7$, $x+4$ and $2x+1$.  The perimeter of the triangle is 36.  What is the length of the longest side of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since the perimeter of the triangle is 36, then $7+(x+4)+(2x+1)=36$ or $3x+12=36$ or $3x=24$ or $x=8$.\n\nThus, the lengths of the three sides of the triangle are $7$, $8+4=12$ and $2(8)+1=17$, of which the longest is $\\boxed{17}.$",
