    "solution": "First, we shall sketch! [asy]\npair A, B, C, D;\nA = (0,90);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (56,0);\nD = (56*90/(90+106),0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, NE);\nlabel(\"$90$\", (A + B)/2, W);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (B + C)/2, S);\nlabel(\"$2x-6$\", (A + C)/2, NE);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,B,C,90));\n[/asy] The first step is to find $x.$ To do this, we simply plug into the Pythagorean Theorem: \\begin{align*}\nAB^2 + BC^2 &= AC^2 \\\\\n90^2 + x^2 &= (2x - 6)^2 \\\\\n8100 + x^2 &= 4x^2 - 24x + 36 \\\\\n0 &= 3x^2 - 24x - 8064 \\\\\n0 &= x^2 - 8x - 2688 \\\\\n0 &= (x - 56)(x + 48).\n\\end{align*} The factorization is a little tricky, especially with a large constant term like $-2688,$ but it helps noticing that $2688$ is close to $52^2 = 2704,$ and the $-8x$ term indicates that our factors that multiply to $-2688$ have to be close. That helps narrow our search greatly.\n\nIn any case, clearly $x = -48$ is extraneous, so we have that $x = 56.$ Therefore, we have $AC = 106$ and $BC = 56.$ (Did you know that $28:45:53$ is a Pythagorean triple?)\n\nNow, to find the area of $\\triangle ADC$ is straightforward. First, clearly the height to base $DC$ is $90,$ so we only really need to find $DC.$ Here we use the Angle Bisector Theorem: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{BD}{DC} &= \\frac{AB}{AC}\\\\\n\\frac{BD}{DC} &= \\frac{90}{106} = \\frac{45}{53}\\\\\n1 + \\frac{BD}{DC} &= 1 + \\frac{45}{53}\\\\\n\\frac{BD + DC}{DC} = \\frac{BC}{DC} &= \\frac{98}{53}\\\\\n\\frac{56}{DC} &= \\frac{98}{53}\\\\\nDC &= \\frac{53}{98} \\cdot 56 = \\frac{212}{7}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nOur area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 90 \\cdot \\frac{212}{7} = 1362\\frac{6}{7} \\approx \\boxed{1363}.$",
