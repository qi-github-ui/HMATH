    "solution": "Because the figure has rotational symmetry, $Q$ is the midpoint of $ZW$. Consequently, the triangles $BZQ$ and $BWQ$ have the same area because they share a height and have bases that are the same length. We have\n\n$$[BQW]=\\dfrac{1}{2}[BZW]=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left([ABWZ]-[ABZ]\\right)$$$$=\\dfrac{1}{2}\\left(120-\\dfrac{1}{2}\\cdot6\\cdot12\\right)=\\dfrac{1}{2}(120-36)=\\dfrac{84}{2}=\\boxed{42}.$$",
