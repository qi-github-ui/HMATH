Also, $\\angle AEB$ cuts off the two arcs $\\widehat{AB}$ and $\\widehat{CD}$, so $m\\angle AEB=(m\\,\\widehat{AB}-m\\,\\widehat{CD}) / 2$.  Subsituting $m\\, \\widehat{AB}=180^\\circ$ and $m\\angle AEB=60^\\circ$ into this equation, we find $m\\,\\widehat{CD}=60^\\circ$.  By symmetry, $\\angle AOC$ and $\\angle DOB$ are congruent, so each one measures $(180-60)/2=60$ degrees.  It follows that $AOC$ and $DOB$ are equilateral triangles.  Therefore, we can find the area of each shaded region by subtracting the area of an equilateral triangle from the area of a sector.\n\nThe area of sector $AOC$ is $\\left(\\frac{m\\angle AOC}{360^\\circ}\\right)\\pi (\\text{radius})^2=\\frac{1}{6}\\pi(6)^2=6\\pi$.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4,$ so the area of triangle $AOC$ is $9\\sqrt{3}$.  In total, the area of the shaded region is $2(6\\pi-9\\sqrt{3})=12\\pi-18\\sqrt{3}.$  Therefore, $(a,b,c)=(12,18,3)$ and $a+b+c=\\boxed{33}$.",
