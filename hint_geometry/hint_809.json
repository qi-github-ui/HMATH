    "problem": "The dimensions of a triangle are tripled to form a new triangle. If the area of the new triangle is 54 square feet, how many square feet were in the area of the original triangle?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If two similar triangles have side ratios of $r : 1,$ the ratio of their areas must be $r^2 : 1.$ That means that when a triangle is tripled to form a new triangle, the new triangle has 9 times the area of the original. That means the original triangle must have an area of $\\dfrac{54\\text{ ft}^2}{9} = \\boxed{6}\\text{ ft}^2.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the concept of similar triangles and how the side ratios determine their similarity?\n2. How does tripling the dimensions of a triangle affect its area?\n3. Why is the ratio of the areas of similar triangles squared? Can you provide an example to illustrate this?\n4. How can we use the given information about the area of the new triangle to find the area of the original triangle?\n5. In general, if a triangle is scaled by a factor of $k$, how does it affect the area of the triangle? Can you express this relationship mathematically?\n6. Can you think of any other scenarios where a similar approach can be used to find the area of a shape?"
