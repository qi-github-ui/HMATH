    "solution": "Draw a line segment from $A$ to $B,$ cutting the shaded diamond region in half. Next, draw the altitude from point $E$ to segment $AB.$ The new figure is shown below: [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(10,0));\ndraw((10,0)--(10,10));\ndraw((10,10)--(0,10));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,10));\ndraw((0,0)--(5,10));\ndraw((5,10)--(10,0));\ndraw((0,10)--(5,0));\ndraw((5,0)--(10,10));\nfill((5,0)--(7.5,5)--(5,10)--(2.5,5)--cycle,lightgray);\ndraw((5,0)--(5,10));\ndraw((5,5)--(7.5,5));\nlabel(\"A\",(5,10),N);\nlabel(\"B\",(5,0),S);\nlabel(\"C\",(10,0),S);\nlabel(\"D\",(10,10),N);\nlabel(\"E\",(7.5,5),E);\nlabel(\"F\",(5,5),W);\n[/asy] $ABCD$ is a rectangle by symmetry of the square over line $AB.$ Thus, $\\angle BAD = 90$ degrees. Since $\\angle BAD = \\angle BFE,$ we have $\\triangle BFE \\sim \\triangle BAD.$ Since the diagonals of $ABCD$ bisect each other, $BE=BD/2,$ so the triangles are similar in a $1:2$ ratio. Thus, $FE$ is half the length of $AD,$ or $4/2=2$ cm.\n\nThe area of triangle $ABE$ is $$\\frac{AB\\cdot FE}{2}=\\frac{8\\cdot2}{2}=8.$$ The other half of the shaded region is identical and has the same area, so the entire shaded region has area $2\\cdot8=\\boxed{16}$ square cm.\n\nWe also might take a clever rearrangement approach. The two red pieces below can be rearranged to form a quadrilateral that is congruent to the gray quadrilateral, as can the two blue pieces, and as can the two green pieces. So, the area of the gray quadrilateral is $\\frac 1 4$ of the area of the square.
