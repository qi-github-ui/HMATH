By power of a point from $P$, $x\\cdot(27+y) = 30$, and by power of a point from $Q$, $y\\cdot(27+x) = 84$. Subtracting the first from the second, $27\\cdot(y-x) = 54$, so $y = x+2$. Now, $x\\cdot(29+x) = 30$, and we find $x = 1, -30$. Since $-30$ makes no sense, we take $x = 1$ and obtain $XY = 1 + 27 + 3 = \\boxed{31}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the given problem in your own words?\n2. What do the points A, B, C, D, P, Q, X, and Y represent in the diagram?\n3.

According to the power of a point theorem, what equation can we write for point P and point Q on the circle? \n6. How can we simplify the equations from step 5 to solve for X and Y? \n7.

How can we verify that our solution for XY is correct? \n10. How does changing the length of segment PQ affect the length of segment XY?"
