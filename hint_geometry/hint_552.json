Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac12\\right)$, so $\\sin 150^\\circ = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of sin of an angle in a right triangle?\n2. How can we apply the definition of sin to a point on the unit circle to find its y-coordinate?\n3. How can we determine the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle given its y-coordinate and the fact that it lies on the circle?\n4. What is the relationship between the angle formed by the origin, the x-axis, and a point on the unit circle and the reference angle?\n5. How does the reference angle help us determine the sign of the trigonometric function in each quadrant?\n6. Can you explain why the coordinates of $P$ are $\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac12\\right)$ using the unit circle?\n7. If we changed the angle to 210 degrees, how would that change the coordinates of the point on the unit circle and our calculation of sin?"
