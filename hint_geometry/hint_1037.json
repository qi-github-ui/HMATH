    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "We draw and label a diagram as follows: [asy]\n\nsize(110);\npair O = (0,0); pair A = (.3,.94); pair B = (.3,.075);\ndraw(O--A--B--cycle,heavycyan);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W); label(\"$A$\",A,N); label(\"$B$\",B,S);\nimport solids; import three; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); currentprojection = orthographic(5,0,1.3);\nrevolution c = cylinder((0,0,0), .4, .91);\ndraw(c,black);\n\ndraw(scale(1,.25)*arc((0,0),1,0,180),dashed);\ndraw(scale(1,.25)*arc((0,0),1,180,360));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,180));\n\n[/asy]\n\nLet the center of the hemisphere be $O$, and let $A$ be a point on the circumference of the top circle of the cylinder.  Since the cylinder is inscribed in the hemisphere, $A$ lies on the hemisphere as well, so $OA=5$.  We drop a perpendicular from $A$ to the base of the hemisphere and let it intersect the base of the hemisphere at $B$.  Since the cylinder is right and $AB$ is a height of the cylinder, $\\angle OBA$ is a right angle, and $B$ lies on the circumference of the bottom circle of the cylinder.  Thus, $OB$ is a radius of the cylinder, so $OB=2$. We have that $\\triangle OBA$ is right, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\[AB=\\sqrt{OA^2-OB^2}=\\sqrt{5^2-2^2}=\\sqrt{21}.\\]Thus, the height of the cylinder is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{21}}$.",
