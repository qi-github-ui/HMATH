    "problem": "Point $A$ has coordinates $(x,6)$. When Point $A$ is reflected over the $y$-axis it lands on Point $B$. What is the sum of the four coordinate values of points $A$ and $B$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The coordinates of point $B$ are $(-x,6)$.  The sum of all four coordinates is $x+6+(-x)+6=\\boxed{12}$.",

In what direction does the x-coordinate change during a reflection over the y-axis? \n4. What are the coordinates of point A after it is reflected over the y-axis? \n5. Can you explain why the y-coordinate remains the same after the reflection? \n6. How can we find the sum of the x and y coordinates of points A and B? \n7. What is the sum of the x-coordinates of points A and B?\n8. What is the sum of the y-coordinates of points A and B?\n9. What is the overall sum of the four coordinate values of points A and B?"
