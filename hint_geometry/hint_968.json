We can now employ the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle $ABH$ to compute \\[ BH = \\sqrt{(AB)^2-(AH)^2} = \\sqrt{4^2-3^2} = \\sqrt{7}. \\] Finally, we use the Pythagorean Theorem in triangle $BHC$ to find that \\[ BC = \\sqrt{(BH)^2+(HC)^2} = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{7})^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{8} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}. \\]",
