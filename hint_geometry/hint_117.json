    "problem": "A right triangle has a side length of 21 inches and a hypotenuse of 29 inches. A second triangle is similar to the first and has a hypotenuse of 87 inches. What is the length of the shortest side of the second triangle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we calculate that the other leg of the original right triangle must be $$\\sqrt{29^2 - 21^2} = \\sqrt{841 - 441} = \\sqrt{400} = 20$$ inches. Since 87 is 3 times 29, the length of the shortest side of the second triangle must be $3 \\times 20 = \\boxed{60\\text{ inches}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How did we determine the length of the other leg of the original right triangle? \n2. Can you explain how the Pythagorean Theorem applies to this problem? \n3. How did we determine that the second triangle is similar to the first? \n4. In what way(s) do similar triangles differ from congruent triangles? \n5. How does the ratio of corresponding side lengths in similar triangles help us find the length of the shortest side of the second triangle? \n6. Are there other methods or formulas that can be used to solve similar triangle problems? \n7. How would the solution change if the original triangle had a different side length or hypotenuse? \n8. Can you think of real-world applications where understanding similar triangles is important?"
