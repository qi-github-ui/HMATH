    "solution": "Since $G$ and $H$ are midpoints, we know that $DG=GC$ and $EH=HF.$ From vertical angles, we can see that $\\angle DHE\\equiv \\angle FHJ.$ Finally, from parallel lines, it is clear that $\\angle DEH\\equiv \\angle HFJ.$ We have now found two angles and a side equal in triangles $DEH$ and $JFH,$ so therefore, $\\triangle DEH\\equiv \\triangle JFH.$   Looking at areas, we have: \\begin{align*}\n[CDEF]&=[CDHF]+[DEH] \\\\\n[CDJ]&=[CDHF]+[HFJ]\n\\end{align*} However, we just proved that $\\triangle DEH\\equiv \\triangle JFH,$ and so $[HFJ]=[DEH].$ Therefore,$$[CDEF]=[CDJ]=\\boxed{36}.$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem? What do you think we should do first?\n2. How do we know that points G and H are midpoints? What properties or characteristics do we use to determine this?\n3. What can we conclude about the angles DHE and FHJ? Can you explain why they are equal?\n4. How can we use the fact that the lines CD and EF are parallel to determine the relationship between the angles DEH and HFJ?\n5. How does the fact that triangles DEH and JFH have two equal angles and a corresponding side equal allow us to conclude that they are congruent?\n6. What do we know about the areas of triangles DEH and JFH? How can we use this information to find the area of triangle CDJ?\n7. Can you explain why the area of triangle CDJ is equal to the area of the parallelogram CDEF? Does this result surprise you?"
