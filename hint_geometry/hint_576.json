    "solution": "Triangle $ACD$ is an isosceles triangle with a $60^\\circ$ angle, so it is also equilateral. Therefore, the length of $\\overline{AC}$ is $\\boxed{17}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of a quadrilateral, and what are the properties of its sides and angles?\n2. How is the measure of angle $ADC$ related to the other angles in the quadrilateral?\n3. How can we apply the Law of Cosines to find the length of diagonal $\\overline{AC}$?\n4. How do we use the given side lengths and angle measure to form the appropriate cosine equation?\n5. Can we simplify the cosine equation using trigonometric identities?\n6. How do we solve the equation for the length of diagonal $\\overline{AC}$?\n7. Are there any other methods we could use to find the length of diagonal $\\overline{AC}$ in this quadrilateral?\n8. How could we generalize this problem and explore other similar cases involving angles and side lengths in quadrilaterals?"
