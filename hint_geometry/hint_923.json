    "solution": "Looking at triangle $ABD$, we see that $\\angle BAD = 180^\\circ - \\angle ABD - \\angle ADB = 180^\\circ - 40^\\circ - 55^\\circ = 85^\\circ$.  Then $\\angle ABD < \\angle ADB < \\angle BAD$, so $AD < AB < BD$.\n\nLooking at triangle $BCD$, we see that $\\angle BCD = 180^\\circ - \\angle CBD - \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ - 75^\\circ - 55^\\circ = 50^\\circ$.  Then $\\angle BCD < \\angle BDC < \\angle CBD$, so $BD < BC < CD$.\n\nCombining both inequalities, we see that \\[AD < AB < BD < BC < CD.\\]Therefore, the longest segment is $\\boxed{CD}$.",
