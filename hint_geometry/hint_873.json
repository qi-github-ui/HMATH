    "solution": "Diagonals $\\overline{AC}$, $\\overline{CE}$, $\\overline{EA}$, $\\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{CF}$, and $\\overline{EB}$ divide the hexagon into twelve congruent 30-60-90 triangles, six of which make up equilateral $\\triangle ACE$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G;\n\nA = (0,0);\nC = (7,1);\nE = rotate(60)*(C);\nG = (A + C + E)/3;\nB = 2*G - E;\nD = 2*G - A;\nF = 2*G - C;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--cycle);\ndraw((-2,0)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,-2)--(0,8));\ndraw(A--C--E--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, S);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, dir(0));\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, N);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, W);\n[/asy]\n\nBecause $AC=\\sqrt{7^2+1^2}=\\sqrt{50}$, the area of $\\triangle ACE$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\displaystyle\\left(\\sqrt{50}\\displaystyle\\right)^2=\\frac{25}{2}\\sqrt{3}$. The area of hexagon $ABCDEF$ is $2\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{25}{2}\\sqrt{3}\\displaystyle\\right)=\\boxed{25\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nAn alternate way to start: let $O$ be the center of the hexagon.  Then triangles $ABC,CDE,$ and $EFA$ are congruent to triangles $AOC,COE,$ and $EOA$, respectively.  Thus the area of the hexagon is twice the area of equilateral $\\triangle ACE$.  Then proceed as in the first solution.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what a regular hexagon is and what are its properties?\n2. How can we find the length of diagonal AC using the coordinates of its endpoints?\n3. Why do the diagonals $\\overline{AC}$, $\\overline{CE}$, and $\\overline{EA}$ divide the hexagon into congruent 30-60-90 triangles? \n4. How can we find the area of one of the 30-60-90 triangles using the length of diagonal AC?\n5. How can we find the area of the equilateral $\\triangle ACE$ using the formula for the area of a triangle?\n6. Why do we multiply the area of $\\triangle ACE$ by 2 to get the area of the hexagon?\n7. Can you think of other regular polygons with which we can use a similar approach to find their areas?"
