    "problem": "A pentagon is formed by cutting a triangular corner from a rectangular piece of paper. The five sides of the pentagon have lengths $13,$ $19,$ $20,$ $25$ and $31,$ in some order. Find the area of the pentagon.",

    "solution": "Let the sides of the pentagon be $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d$ and $e,$ and let $r$ and $s$ be the legs of the triangular region cut off, as shown.[asy]\nsize(6cm);\npair A=(0,0),B=(0,5),C=(8,5),D=(8,0),E=(8,2),F=(5.5,5);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--A^^E--F);\nlabel(\"$c$\",A--B,W);\nlabel(\"$d$\",B--F,N);\nlabel(\"$e$\",E--F,SW);\nlabel(\"$a$\",E--D,dir(0));\nlabel(\"$b$\",D--A,S);\nlabel(\"$r$\",F--C,N);\nlabel(\"$s$\",C--E,dir(0));\n[/asy] By the Pythagorean theorem, $r^2+s^2=e^2.$ Furthermore, we have $r=b-d$ and $s=c-a,$ which are integers because $a,b,c,$ and $d$ are integers. Thus, $e$ must be the hypotenuse of some Pythagorean triple. The possibilities for that triple are $$\\{5,12,13\\},\\quad\\{12,16,20\\},\\quad\\{15,20,25\\},\\quad\\{7,24,25\\}.$$Also, the leg lengths $r=b-d$ and $s=c-a$ must be among the pairwise differences of the given numbers. Since $16,$ $15$ and $24$ do not appear among any of the pairwise differences of $\\{13,19,20,25,31\\},$ the only possible triple is $\\{5,12,13\\}.$ Then we may take $r=b-d=5$ and $s=c-a=12,$ and this forces $a=19,$ $b=25,$ $c=31,$ $d=20$ and $e=13.$ Hence, the area of the pentagon is $$bc - \\frac12 rs = 31 \\cdot 25 -\\frac 12(12\\cdot 5)= 775-30=\\boxed{745}.$$",
