    "problem": "Two triangles are similar. The ratio of their areas is 1:4. If the height of the smaller triangle is 3 cm, how long is the corresponding height of the larger triangle, in centimeters?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If any linear dimension (such as radius, side length, height, etc.) of a closed, two-dimensional figure is multiplied by $k$ while the shape of the figure remains the same, the area of the figure is multiplied by $k^2$.  Since the area is multiplied by 4 in going from the smaller triangle to the larger triangle, we have $k^2=4$ which implies $k=2$.  Therefore, each linear dimension is multiplied by 2, so the height of the larger triangle is $(3\\text{ cm})\\times2=\\boxed{6}$ centimeters.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you define what it means for two triangles to be similar?\n2. How does the ratio of areas between similar two-dimensional figures change as their corresponding linear dimensions are scaled by a constant factor?\n3. Can you explain how we can use the above property to find the corresponding linear dimension of a similar figure given the area ratio and known linear dimension of the other figure?\n4. How can we use the given information about the area ratio and the height of the smaller triangle to find the corresponding height of the larger triangle?\n5. Is there a general formula we can use to find the ratio of corresponding linear dimensions given the area ratio between two similar figures?\n6. Can you provide an example of a real-life situation where understanding the concept of similar figures and their properties would be useful?"
