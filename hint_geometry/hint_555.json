    "solution": "From right triangle $ABD$, we have $\\sin A = \\frac{BD}{AB} = \\frac{BD}{24}$.  Since $\\sin A = \\frac23$, we have $\\frac23 = \\frac{BD}{24}$, so $BD = \\frac23\\cdot 24 = 16$.\n\nFrom right triangle $BCD$, we have $\\sin C = \\frac{BD}{BC}=\\frac{16}{BC}$.  Since $\\sin C = \\frac13$, we have $\\frac{16}{BC} = \\frac13$.  Therefore, we have $BC = 3\\cdot 16=48$.  Finally, the Pythagorean Theorem gives us \\begin{align*}\nCD &= \\sqrt{BC^2 - BD^2}\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{48^2 - 16^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{(3\\cdot 16)^2 - 16^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{9\\cdot 16^2 - 16^2} = \\sqrt{8\\cdot 16^2} = 2\\cdot 16 \\sqrt{2} = \\boxed{32\\sqrt{2}}.\\end{align*}",
