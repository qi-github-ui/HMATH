    "solution": "Angles $\\angle DCB$ and $\\angle B$ are alternate interior angles, so they are congruent. Therefore, $m\\angle B=40^\\circ$.\n\nSince $AC=BC$, triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles with equal angles at $A$ and $B$. Therefore, $m\\angle A=40^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, $\\angle A$ and $\\angle ECD$ are corresponding angles, so $m\\angle ECD=m\\angle A = \\boxed{40}$ degrees.",
