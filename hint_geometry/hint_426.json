    "problem": "The points $B(1, 1)$, $I(2, 4)$ and $G(5, 1)$ are plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system to form triangle $BIG$. Triangle $BIG$ is translated five units to the left and two units upward to triangle $B'I'G'$, in such a way that $B'$ is the image of $B$, $I'$ is the image of $I$, and $G'$ is the image of $G$. What is the midpoint of segment $B'G'$? Express your answer as an ordered pair.",

    "solution": "Since triangle $B^\\prime I^\\prime G^\\prime$ is translated from triangle $BIG,$ the midpoint of $B^\\prime G ^\\prime $ is the midpoint of $BG$ translated five units left and two units up. The midpoint of $BG$ is at $\\left( \\frac{1+5}{2}, \\frac{1+1}{2} \\right) = (3, 1).$ Thus, the midpoint of $B ^\\prime G ^\\prime$ is at $(3-5,1+2)=\\boxed{(-2,3)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the location of the three points $B(1,1)$, $I(2,4)$, and $G(5,1)$ in the rectangular coordinate system? \n2. After the translation, what are the new coordinates of the points $B$, $I$, and $G$? \n3. How do you find the midpoint of a segment? \n4. What is the midpoint of segment $BG$? \n5. How does the translation affect the coordinates of the midpoint of $BG$? \n6. What is the distance between the midpoint of $BG$ and the midpoint of $B'G'$ after the translation? \n7. Can you generalize a formula for finding the midpoint of a segment after it is translated in the coordinate plane? \n8. Are there other transformations in the coordinate plane that can be used to find the image of a figure? \n9. How does the concept of translation apply to other geometrical shapes and figures?"
