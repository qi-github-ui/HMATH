What properties or characteristics of the triangle are given in the problem statement?\n3. How do we know that M is the midpoint of QR?\n4. How can we use the concept of medians in this triangle to find the length of QN?\n5. Can you explain why GN is equal to one-third of QN?\n6. How can we find the length of GP using the lengths of GN and NP?\n7. Can you explain why GP is equal to two times the square root of the sum of GN squared and NP squared?\n8.
