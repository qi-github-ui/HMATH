    "solution": "Since $\\triangle ABC$ is equilateral with side length 12 and $X$ and $Y$ are the midpoints of $CA$ and $CB$ respectively, we have $CX=CY=\\frac{1}{2}(12)=6$.  Since the height of the prism is 16 and $Z$ is the midpoint of $CD$ we have $CZ = \\frac{1}{2}(16)=8$.\n\nWe have $\\angle ACD = \\angle BCD = 90^\\circ$ since faces $ACDE$ and $BCDF$ are rectangles.  Thus, $\\triangle XCZ$ and $\\triangle YCZ$ are right-angled at $C$.  By the Pythagorean Theorem, \\[XZ = \\sqrt{CX^2 + CZ^2} = \\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=\\sqrt{100}=10\\]and \\[YZ = \\sqrt{CY^2 + CZ^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \\sqrt{100} = 10.\\]Now we look at $\\triangle CXY$.  We know that $CX = CY = 6$ and that $\\angle XCY = 60^\\circ$, because $\\triangle ABC$ is equilateral.  Thus, $\\triangle CXY$ is isosceles with $\\angle CXY = \\angle CYX$. These angles must each be equal to $\\frac{1}{2}(180^\\circ - \\angle XCY) = \\frac{1}{2}(180^\\circ - 60^\\circ)=60^\\circ$. Thus $\\triangle CXY$ is equilateral, so $XY = CX = CY = 6$.\n\nFinally, $XY = 6$ and $XZ = YZ = 10$. The perimeter is then $10+10+6=\\boxed{26}$.",
