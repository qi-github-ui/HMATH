    "solution": "Each of the sides of the square is divided into two segments by a vertex of the rectangle.  Call the lengths of these two segments $r$ and $s$.  Also, let $C$ be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from $A$ to the side containing the point $B$.  Since $AC=r+s$ and $BC=|r-s|$, \\[\n(r+s)^2+(r-s)^2=12^2,\n\\] from the Pythagorean theorem.  This simplifies to $2r^2+2s^2=144$, since the terms $2rs$ and $-2rs$ sum to 0.  The combined area of the four removed triangles is $\\frac{1}{2}r^2+\\frac{1}{2}s^2+\\frac{1}{2}r^2+\\frac{1}{2}s^2=r^2+s^2$.  From the equation $2r^2+2s^2=144$, this area is $144/2=\\boxed{72}$ square units.
