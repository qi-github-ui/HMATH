    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in computing $\\sin 0^\\circ$ using the given information about rotating a point counterclockwise? \n2. What does the point $(1,0)$ represent in terms of angles and trigonometric functions? \n3. Why does rotating the point $(1,0)$ by $0^\\circ$ keep the point at the same location? How does this relate to the value of $\\sin 0^\\circ$? \n4. Are there any other trigonometric functions that we can determine the value of using this same reasoning? If so, which ones? \n5. How does the concept of rotating a point relate to the concept of finding trigonometric values? \n6. Can you think of any other scenarios where we might use a similar approach to determine the value of a trigonometric function?"
