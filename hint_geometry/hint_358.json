Since $\\tan Z = 3$, we have $XY = 3k$ and $XZ = k$ for some value of $k$, as shown in the diagram.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem gives $YZ^2 = (3k)^2 + k^2 = 10k^2$, so $YZ = k\\sqrt{10}$.\n\nFinally, we have $\\cos Z = \\frac{XZ}{YZ} = \\frac{k}{k\\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{10}}$.",
