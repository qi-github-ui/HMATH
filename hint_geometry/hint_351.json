    "solution": "Draw horizontal diameters of both circles to form two rectangles, both surrounding shaded regions. The height of each rectangle is a radius and the length is a diameter, so the left rectangle is 2 ft $\\times$ 4 ft and the right rectangle is 4 ft $\\times$ 8 ft. The shaded region is obtained by subtracting respective semicircles from each rectangle, so the total area of the shaded region in square feet is $A = [(2)(4) - \\dfrac{1}{2}\\pi \\cdot(2)^2] +\n[(4)(8) - \\dfrac{1}{2}\\pi \\cdot(4)^2] = 40 - 10\\pi \\approx \\boxed{8.6}$.\n\nEquivalently, we could notice that since the right side of the figure is scaled up from the left side by a factor of 2, areas will be scaled by a factor of $2^2 = 4$, and the right shaded region will be 4 times the size of the left shaded region. Then $A = 5[(2)(4) - \\dfrac{1}{2}\\pi \\cdot(2)^2],$ giving the same result.",
