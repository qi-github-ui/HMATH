    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The triangle is shown below:\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C;\nA = (0,0);\nB = (10,0);\nC = (10,15);\ndraw(A--B--C--A);\ndraw(rightanglemark(C,B,A,26));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\n[/asy]\n\nWe have $\\sin A = \\frac{BC}{AC}$ and $\\cos A = \\frac{AB}{AC}$, so $2\\sin A = 3\\cos A$ gives us $2\\cdot \\frac{BC}{AC} = 3\\cdot\\frac{AB}{AC}$.  Multiplying both sides by $AC$ gives $2BC = 3AB$, so $AB= \\frac23 BC$.\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem gives us $AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2$.  Substituting $AB = \\frac23BC$ gives \\[\\left(\\frac23BC\\right)^2 + BC^2 = AC^2.\\]Simplifying the left side gives $\\frac{13}{9}BC^2 = AC^2$, so $\\frac{BC^2}{AC^2} = \\frac{9}{13}$, which means \\[\\sin A = \\frac{BC}{AC} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{13}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{9}}{\\sqrt{13}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{13}} = \\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{13}}{13}}.\\]We also could have noted that $(\\sin A)^2 + (\\cos A)^2 = 1$ for any angle $A$, so $2\\sin A = 3\\cos A$ gives us $\\cos A = \\frac23 \\sin A$ and $(\\sin A)^2 + \\left(\\frac23\\sin A\\right)^2 = 1$, which gives $\\frac{13}{9}(\\sin A)^2= 1$.  Therefore, we have $(\\sin A)^2 = \\frac{9}{13}$.  Since $A$ is an acute angle, we have $\\sin A > 0$, so $(\\sin A)^2 = \\frac{9}{13}$ gives us \\[\\sin A = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{13}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{9}}{\\sqrt{13}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{13}} = \\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{13}}{13}}.\\]",
