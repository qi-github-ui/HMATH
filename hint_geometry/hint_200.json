    "solution": "The diameter of the large circle is $6+4=10$, so its radius is 5. Hence, the area of the shaded region is $$\n\\pi(5^2)-\\pi(3^2)-\\pi(2^2)=\\pi(25-9-4)=\\boxed{12\\pi}.\n$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the given figure in your own words?\n2. What do you already know about circles and their properties that might be useful in solving this problem?\n3. How can you determine the radius of the larger circle, given the radii of the smaller circles?\n4. What is the relationship between the diameter and radius of a circle? How does this relate to the given information?\n5. Can you draw any auxiliary lines or shapes to help you visualize and solve the problem?\n6. How can you find the area of the shaded region using the information you've gathered?\n7. Are there any alternative methods or formulas you can use to check your answer?"
