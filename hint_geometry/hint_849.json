    "problem": "The sides of triangle $CAB$ are in the ratio of $2:3:4$. Segment $BD$ is the angle bisector drawn to the shortest side, dividing it into segments $AD$ and $DC$. What is the length, in inches, of the longer subsegment of side $AC$ if the length of side $AC$ is $10$ inches? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Without loss of generality, suppose that $BA < BC$. Since $BD$ is the angle bisector of $\\angle B$, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, it follows that $$\\frac{AD}{CD} = \\frac{BA}{BC} = \\frac 34.$$ Thus, $AD < CD$, so $CD$ is the longer subsegment of $AC$. Solving for $AD$, it follows that $AD = \\frac{3CD}{4}$. Also, we know that $AD + CD = AC = 10$, and substituting our previous value for $AD$, we find that $\\frac{3CD}{4} + CD = \\frac {7CD}4 = 10 \\Longrightarrow CD = \\boxed{\\frac {40}7}$ inches.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the ratio of the sides of triangle CAB and the lengths of each side?\n2. What is the importance of segment BD and its relationship to the triangle?\n3. How can we determine the lengths of segments AD and CD in relation to each other?\n4. How can we use the Angle Bisector Theorem to find the ratio of AD to CD? \n5. Based on the given ratio of sides, which segment of side AC is longer, AD or CD?\n6. How can we express the length of the longer subsegment of AC using the given ratio and the length of AC?\n7. Can you calculate the length, in inches, of the longer subsegment of side AC given the length of AC as 10 inches?"
