    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the Angle Bisector Theorem and how does it apply to this problem?\n2. Can you explain why the ratio of BX to AX is equal to the ratio of BC to AC?\n3. Can you think of a similar problem where the Angle Bisector Theorem can be applied?\n4. How does the fact that triangles BCX and ACX share the same height help us find the ratio of their areas?\n5. Can you prove that the areas of triangles BCX and ACX are proportional to the lengths of their bases?\n6. Is there another method besides using the Angle Bisector Theorem that can help us find the ratio of the areas?\n7. How would the ratio of the areas change if the length of CX were different?"
