    "solution": "The seven points divide the circumference of the circle into seven equal small arcs each with measure $\\frac{360^\\circ}{7}$.\n\n$\\angle ACE$ cuts off a minor arc $\\widehat{AE}$, which consists of three small arcs and thus \\[\\widehat{AE}=3\\cdot \\frac{360^\\circ}{7}.\\]It follows that \\[\\angle ACE = 3\\cdot \\frac{360^\\circ}{7} \\cdot\\frac{1}{ 2} = \\frac{3\\cdot 180^\\circ}{7}.\\]Each tip of the star is formed by an angle which cuts off three small arcs in a similar fashion.  Thus each tip of the star measures $\\frac{3\\cdot 180^\\circ}{7}$ and hence all seven tips of the star together measure $3\\cdot 180^\\circ = \\boxed{540}$ degrees.",
