    "problem": "An isosceles triangle has side lengths 8 cm, 8 cm and 10 cm.  The longest side of a similar triangle is 25 cm. What is the perimeter of the larger triangle, in centimeters?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The ratio of the length of the longest sides of the small triangle to the large triangle is $10/25 = 2/5$, which must hold constant for all sides of the two triangles since they are similar.  Thus the perimeters of the two triangles are also in the ratio of $2/5$.  The small triangle has perimeter $8+8+10=26$, so the large triangle has perimeter $\\frac{5}{2}\\cdot 26 = \\boxed{65}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what an isosceles triangle is and its defining characteristics?\n2. How do you determine if two triangles are similar, and what are the necessary conditions for similarity?\n3. How can you use the fact that the triangles are similar to find the ratio of their longest sides?\n4. How does the ratio of the longest sides relate to the ratio of the perimeters of the two triangles?\n5. What is the perimeter of the smaller triangle, and how can you use the ratio of perimeters to find the perimeter of the larger triangle?\n6. Are there other methods you could use to find the perimeter of the larger triangle, and if so, how do they compare to using similarity ratios?"
