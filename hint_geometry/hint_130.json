    "solution": "The circle with center $C$ is the incircle of $\\triangle PQR$. So, any segment from a vertex of the triangle to $C$ is an angle bisector.\n\nThe sum of the measures of the internal angles of a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\angle QRP &= 180^\\circ - \\angle PQR - \\angle QPR \\\\\n&= 180^\\circ - 63^\\circ - 59^\\circ\\\\\n&= 58^\\circ.\n\\end{align*}Since $\\overline{RC}$ bisects $\\angle QRP$, we have $\\angle QRC = \\frac{58^\\circ}{2} = \\boxed{29^\\circ}$.",
