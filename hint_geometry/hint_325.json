    "problem": "An $\\textit{annulus}$ is the region between two concentric circles. The concentric circles in the figure have radii $b$ and $c$, with $b>c$. Let $\\overline{OX}$ be a radius of the larger circle, let $\\overline{XZ}$ be tangent to the smaller circle at $Z$, and let $\\overline{OY}$ be the radius of the larger circle that contains $Z$.  Let $a=XZ$, $d=YZ$, and $e=XY$. What is the area of the annulus? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$ and at most one of the variables $a,b,c,d,e$.\n\n[asy]\npair O,X,Y,Z;\nO=(0,0);\nX=(16,12);\nY=(0,20);\nZ=(0,12);\nfill(Circle(0,20),gray(0.7));\nfill(Circle(0,12),white);\ndraw(Circle(O,20),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle(O,12),linewidth(0.7));\ndot(O);\ndot(X);\ndot(Y);\ndot(Z);\ndraw(O--X--Y--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Z--X,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$b$\",(8,6),SE);\nlabel(\"$a$\",(8,12),S);\nlabel(\"$e$\",(8,16),SW);\nlabel(\"$c$\",(0,6),W);\nlabel(\"$d$\",(0,16),W);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,S);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,NE);\nlabel(\"$Y$\",Y,N);\nlabel(\"$Z$\",Z,SW);\n[/asy]",

    "solution": "The area of the annulus is the difference between the areas of the two circles, which is $\\pi b^2 -\\pi c^2$. Because the tangent $\\overline{XZ}$ is perpendicular to the radius $\\overline{OZ}$, $b^2 -\nc^2 = a^2$, so the area is $\\boxed{\\pi a^2}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the basic concept of an annulus and how it is defined?\n2. What is the relationship between the radii of the concentric circles in an annulus? How can we represent these radii in this specific problem?\n3. Why is the tangent $\\overline{XZ}$ important in calculating the area of the annulus? What does it tell us about the relationship between $b$, $c$, and $a$?\n4. How can we express the difference between the areas of the two circles? Can you write an equation that relates $b$, $c$, and the area of the annulus?\n5. What is the relationship between $b^2 - c^2$ and $a^2$? Why is this relationship significant in calculating the area of the annulus?\n6. Can you simplify the expression for the area of the annulus in terms of $a$ and $\\pi$?"
