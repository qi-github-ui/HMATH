    "solution": "Each of sector $ABD$ and $BDC$ is one-sixth of a full circle of radius $12,$ so each has area one-sixth of the area of a circle of radius $12.$ Therefore, each sector has area $$\\frac{1}{6}(\\pi(12^2))=\\frac{1}{6}(144\\pi)=24\\pi.$$ Thus, the area of figure $ABCD$ is $2( 24\\pi)=\\boxed{48\\pi}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the shape of figure ABCD?\n2. What is the radius of the circle that the sectors are part of?\n3. What is the measure of angle BAC? What about angle BDC?\n4. What is the formula for the area of a sector of a circle? How can you use this formula to find the area of each sector in figure ABCD?\n5. How can you find the area of the entire figure by using the areas of the individual sectors?\n6. Are there any other methods you can use to find the area of figure ABCD? How do they compare to using the areas of the sectors?"
