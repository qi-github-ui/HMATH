    "solution": "Let the side length of the square be $x$.  The triangle has $\\frac{1}{2} x$ as both its base and height.  Therefore, its area is $\\frac{1}{8} x^2$, and since the area of the square is $x^2$, the shaded area is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}$ of the total.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. How do you know that points P and Q are midpoints of two sides of the square?\n3. What is the definition of a midpoint? How does it relate to the sides of a square?\n4. Why do we only need to consider the shaded triangle to find the fraction of the interior that is shaded?\n5. How did you determine the area of the shaded triangle? \n6. What is the formula for finding the area of a triangle given its base and height?\n7. How did you determine the area of the entire square?\n8. How did you calculate the fraction of the interior that is shaded?\n9. Can you think of any other shapes or figures where you could apply similar reasoning to find the fraction of the interior that is shaded?"
