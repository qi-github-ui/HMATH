    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "$\\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle, since $9^2 + 12^2 = 15^2$. Thus, $\\angle ABC = 90^\\circ$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D;\n\nA = (0,9);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (12,0);\nD = (0,4);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--D);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, W);\n[/asy]\n\nBy the angle bisector theorem, $BD/AD = BC/AC$, so \\[BD = \\frac{BC}{BC + AC} \\cdot AB = \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot 9 = 4.\\] Then by use of the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $BCD$, $CD = \\sqrt{BC^2 + BD^2} = \\sqrt{12^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{160} = \\boxed{4 \\sqrt{10}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the angle bisector theorem, and how is it used here to find the length of $BD$?\n2. What is the Pythagorean theorem, and how is it used to find the length of $CD$ in right triangle $BCD$?\n3. Can we use a similar approach to find the length of the angle bisector from a vertex to the opposite side in a different triangle? If so, what is that approach and why does it work?\n4. What would happen to the length of $CD$ if $AB$, $BC$, or $AC$ were changed? Would there be any values of these side lengths that make it impossible to construct triangle $ABC$?\n5. If we knew the length of $CD$ and wanted to find the length of $AB$, how could we use the angle bisector theorem to do so? Would there be any other ways to find the length of $AB$ in terms of the other side lengths?\n6. What would happen to the length of $CD$ if angle $C$ were not a right angle? Would the angle bisector theorem and Pythagorean theorem still be useful in finding its length?"
