    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a right triangle is and what the right angle represents in this context?\n2. Based on the given information, how can we find the length of the side $XZ$ in the triangle $XYZ$?\n3. What equation can we use to find the length of side $XZ$?\n4. Why is the Pythagorean Theorem appropriate for this situation?\n5. How do we apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of side $XZ$?\n6. What is the resulting equation and how do we solve it to find the value of $XZ$?\n7. Once we have the values of $XZ$ and $XY$, how can we use them to find the tangent of angle $Y$?\n8. What is the formula for tangent and how can it be applied in this situation?\n9. Plugging in the values we found, what is the value of $\\tan Y$ in this right triangle?\n10. Can you think of any other similar triangles where we can apply the Pythagorean Theorem and find the tangent of an angle in a similar manner?"
