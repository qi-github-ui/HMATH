    "solution": "Both angles $\\angle BAD$ and $\\angle CBE$ subtend arc $BE$, so $\\angle CBE = \\angle BAE = 43^\\circ$.  Triangle $BCE$ is isosceles with $BC = CE$, since these are tangent from the same point to the same circle, so $\\angle CEB = \\angle CBE = 43^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, $\\angle AEB = 90^\\circ$ since $AB$ is a diameter, so $\\angle BED = 90^\\circ$.  Therefore, $\\angle CED = \\angle BED - \\angle BEC = 90^\\circ - 43^\\circ = \\boxed{47^\\circ}$.",
