    "solution": "Since $ABCDE$ is a regular pentagon, we know by symmetry that the measures of $\\angle CAB$ and $\\angle BCA$ are equal. We also know that the sum of the measures of the angles of $\\triangle ABC$ equals $180$ degrees. Thus, if we let $x = $ the measure of $\\angle CAB$ = the measure of $\\angle BCA$, we have that $180 = 108 + x + x \\Rightarrow 2x = 72 \\Rightarrow x = 36$. The measure of angle $CAB$ is $\\boxed{36}$ degrees.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. Are there any properties or relationships in a regular pentagon that might help us find the angle measure of $\\angle CAB$?\n3. How can we use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees to find the measure of $\\angle CAB$?\n4. Why do we assume that $\\angle CAB$ and $\\angle BCA$ have the same measure?\n5. Can you explain why we set up the equation $180 = 108 + x + x$?\n6. How did we solve the equation $2x = 72$ to find the measure of $\\angle CAB$?\n7. Can you think of any other polygons where we can use similar reasoning and steps to find angle measures?"
