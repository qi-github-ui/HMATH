    "problem": "On an old-fashioned bicycle the front wheel has a radius of $2.5$ feet and the back wheel has a radius of $4$ inches.  If there is no slippage, how many revolutions will the back wheel make while the front wheel makes $100$ revolutions?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The circumference of the front wheel is $2\\pi \\cdot 2.5=5\\pi$ feet. In 100 revolutions, the front wheel travels $5\\pi \\cdot 100 = 500\\pi$ feet. The back wheel must travel the same distance because they are both attached to the same bike. The circumference of the back wheel is $2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ feet (note that 4 inches is equal to $\\frac{1}{3}$ feet). Thus, the number of revolutions of the back wheel is $\\frac{500\\pi}{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi}=\\boxed{750}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the difference in radius between the front and back wheels? \n2. How can we use the circumference formula to determine the distance traveled by each wheel? \n3. What is the total distance traveled by the front wheel after 100 revolutions? \n4. Why must the back wheel also travel the same distance as the front wheel? \n5. How do we calculate the circumference of the back wheel? \n6. What equation can we use to set up and solve for the number of revolutions made by the back wheel? \n7. What is the final answer to the problem and how can we check it for accuracy? \n8. Are there any other factors that could affect the result of this problem, such as slippage or uneven terrain?"
