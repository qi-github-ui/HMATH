    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The midpoint of segment $s_1$ can be found using the midpoint formula: $\\left(\\frac{4-8}2,\\frac{1+5}2\\right)=(-2,3).$  The midpoint of $s_2$ is the translation of the midpoint of $s_1$ be $2$ units to the right and $3$ units up.  Thus its coordinates are $(-2+2,3+3)=\\boxed{(0,6)}.$",
