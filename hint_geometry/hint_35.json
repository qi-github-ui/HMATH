    "solution": "Since the cone is tangent to all sides of the base of the prism, the base of the prism is a square.  Furthermore, if the radius of the base of the cone is $r$, then the side length of the square is $2r$.\n\nLet $h$ be the common height of the cone and the prism.  Then the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h,\\] and the volume of the prism is $(2r)^2 h = 4r^2 h$, so the desired ratio is \\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h}{4r^2 h} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{12}}.\\]",
