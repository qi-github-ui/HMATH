    "problem": "The measures of angles $A$ and $B$ are both positive, integer numbers of degrees. The measure of angle $A$ is a multiple of the measure of angle $B$, and angles $A$ and $B$ are complementary angles. How many measures are possible for angle $A$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The given information tells us that $A = 90^\\circ -B$ and $A=kB$ for some $k\\ge1$.  Therefore, we have $kB = 90^\\circ - B$. This simplifies to $(k+1)B=90^\\circ$. $k+1$ can be any factor of $90$ except one, since $k+1\\ge2$. $90=2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5$ has $2\\cdot3\\cdot2=12$ factors, so there are 11 possible values of $k$. Each value of $k$ uniquely determines the value of $B$ and therefore the value of $A$, so there are $\\boxed{11}$ possible measures for $A$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you restate the given information about angles $A$ and $B$ in your own words?\n2. What does it mean for two angles to be complementary? How does this relate to the given information?\n3. How can we represent the relationship between angles $A$ and $B$ in an equation or equation system?\n4. Can you solve the equation or equation system to find the possible measures for angle $B$?\n5. Can you use the possible measures for angle $B$ to find the corresponding measures for angle $A$?\n6. How can we check that the measures of angles $A$ and $B$ satisfy all the given conditions?"
