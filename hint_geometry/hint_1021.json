    "solution": "Since the ratio of the area of $A$ to the shaded area inside $B$ is $1:3$, the ratio of the area of $A$ to the entire area of $B$ is $1:(3+1) = 1:4$.  Since the area of $B$ is 4 times the area of $A$, the radius of $B$ is twice the radius of $A$, which means the diameter of $A$ is half the diameter of $B$, or $\\boxed{8\\text{ cm}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the given problem statement in your own words?\n2. What does the ratio of the shaded area to the area of circle A tell us about the sizes of the two circles?\n3. How can we relate the ratio of the areas with the ratio of the diameters of the two circles?\n4. How does the ratio of the diameters of the two circles relate to the ratio of their radii?\n5. Can you explain why the ratio of the areas is 1:4 and not 3:1?\n6. Based on the ratio of the areas, what can we conclude about the ratio of the diameters?\n7. How do the diameters of circle A and circle B relate to each other?\n8. How can we use this information to find the diameter of circle A in terms of the given diameter of circle B?\n9. Can you validate your answer by checking if the ratio of the shaded area to the area of circle A is indeed 3:1?"
