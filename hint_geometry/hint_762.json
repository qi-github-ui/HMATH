    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has vertices $A(0, 8)$, $B(2, 0)$, $C(8, 0)$.  A horizontal line with equation $y=t$ intersects line segment $ \\overline{AB} $ at $T$ and line segment $ \\overline{AC} $ at $U$, forming $\\triangle ATU$ with area 13.5.  Compute $t$.",

    "solution": "The line through $A$ and $B$ has slope $\\frac{0-8}{2-0}=-4$ and passes through $(0,8)$, so thus has equation $y=-4x+8$. The line through $A$ and $C$ has slope $\\frac{0-8}{8-0}=-1$ and passes through $(0,8)$, so thus has equation $y=-x+8$.\n\nThe point $T$ is the point on the line $y=-4x+8$ with $y$-coordinate $t$.  To find the $x$-coordinate, we solve $t=-4x+8$ to get $4x = 8-t$ or $x = \\frac{1}{4}(8-t)$.  The point $U$ is the point on the line $y=-x+8$ with $y$-coordinate $t$.  To find the $x$-coordinate, we solve $t=-x+8$ to get $x = 8-t$.\n\nTherefore, $T$ has coordinates $(\\frac{1}{4}(8-t),t)$, $U$ has coordinates $(8-t,t)$, and $A$ is at $(0,8)$.\n\n$TU$ is horizontal and has length $(8-t)-\\frac{1}{4}(8-t)=\\frac{3}{4}(8-t)$ and the distance from $TU$ to $A$ is $8-t$, so the area in terms of $t$ is \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}(8-t)\\right)(8-t) = \\frac{3}{8}(8-t)^2.\\]Since this equals $13.5$, we have $\\frac{3}{8}(8-t)^2 = 13.5$ or $(8-t)^2 = \\frac{8}{3}(13.5)=36$.  Because line segment $TU$ is below $A$, $t<8$, and so $8-t>0$.  Therefore, $8-t=6 \\Rightarrow t=8-6=\\boxed{2}$.",
