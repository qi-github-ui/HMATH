    "problem": "An 8-foot by 10-foot floor is tiled with square tiles of size 1 foot by 1 foot. Each tile has a pattern consisting of four white quarter circles of radius 1/2 foot centered at each corner of the tile. The remaining portion of the tile is shaded. How many square feet of the floor are shaded?\n[asy]\nfill((5,5)--(5,-5)--(-5,-5)--(-5,5)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfill(Circle((-5,5),5),white);\nfill(Circle((5,5),5),white);\nfill(Circle((-5,-5),5),white);\nfill(Circle((5,-5),5),white);\ndraw((-5,5)--(-5,-5)--(5,-5)--(5,5)--cycle);\n[/asy]",

    "solution": "The four white quarter circles in each tile have the same area as a whole circle of radius $1/2$, that is, $\\pi(1/2)^2 = \\pi/4$ square feet. So the area of the shaded portion of each tile is $ 1 - \\pi/4$ square feet. Since there are $8\\cdot 10 = 80$ tiles in the entire floor, the area of the total shaded region in square feet is \\[\n80\\left(1 - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\boxed{80 - 20\\pi}.\n\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find?\n2. Can you describe the pattern on each tile in your own words?\n3. How can we calculate the area of each quarter circle in terms of feet squared?\n4. Taking into account the pattern on each tile, what is the area of the shaded portion of each tile in terms of feet squared?\n5. How can we use the area of one shaded tile to find the total shaded area of the floor?\n6. What is the total shaded area of the floor in terms of feet squared?"
