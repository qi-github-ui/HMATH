    "problem": "In a triangle with integer side lengths, one side is three times as long as a second  side, and the length of the third side is 15. What is the greatest possible perimeter of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $x$, $3x$, and 15. The Triangle Inequality implies that $3x<x+15$, so $x<7.5$. Because $x$ is an integer, the greatest possible perimeter is $7+21+15=\\boxed{43}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe how to approach this problem? What is the first step you would take?\n2. How would you use the Triangle Inequality to help solve this problem?\n3. What does the Triangle Inequality state? Why is it important in this context?\n4. How did you determine the maximum value for the smallest side length, given the information provided?\n5. Why did you choose to set the lengths of the sides as $x$, $3x$, and 15? Is there any particular reason for this choice?\n6. Can you think of any other constraints or conditions that could affect the maximum perimeter of the triangle? How would you consider them in your problem-solving process?\n7. Can you generalize your approach to solve similar problems involving triangles with different side length ratios or restrictions?"
