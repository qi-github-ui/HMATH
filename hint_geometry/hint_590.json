    "solution": "$\\overline{DF}\\|\\overline{BE}$ and $\\overline{DB}\\|\\overline{FE}$ by the midline theorem and $\\angle DBE$ is right, so $DFEB$ is a rectangle. $2BE=BC=AB=2DB$, so $BE=DB$ and $DFEB$ is a square. Say it has side length $2x$; $AB=BC=4x$ and $FG=FH=x$. $\\triangle ABC$ has area $\\frac{(4x)(4x)}{2}=8x^2$, $\\triangle FGH$ has area $\\frac{x^2}{2}$, and $\\triangle DBE$ has area $\\frac{4x^2}{2}=2x^2$. The shaded area is thus $2x^2+\\frac{x^2}{2}=\\frac{5x^2}{2}$, and the non-shaded area is $8x^2-\\frac{5x^2}{2}=\\frac{11x^2}{2}$. Therefore, the ratio of shaded to nonshaded area is \\[\n\\frac{\\frac{5x^2}{2}}{\\frac{11x^2}{2}}=\\frac{5x^2}{11x^2}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{11}}.\n\\]",
