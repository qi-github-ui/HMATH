    "problem": "How many non-similar triangles have angles whose degree measures are distinct positive integers in  arithmetic progression?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let $n-d$, $n$, and $n+d$ be the angles in the triangle. Then \\[\n180 = n-d+n+n+d= 3n, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad n=60.\n\\] Because the sum of the degree measures of two angles of a triangle is less than 180, we have $$180 > n + (n+d) = 120 + d,$$ which implies that $0<d<60$.\n\nThere are $\\boxed{59}$ triangles   with this property.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the minimum value of the difference between the degree measures of the angles in the triangle?\n2. How can we express the degree measures of the three angles in terms of the common difference, d?\n3. Can you find any examples of triangles where the angle measures are in arithmetic progression with a specific common difference?\n4. Is it possible for the degree measures of the angles to be in arithmetic progression with a negative common difference? Why or why not?\n5. How does the sum of the degree measures of the angles relate to the property that the angles form a triangle?\n6. Can you find any patterns or relationships between the degree measures of the angles in the arithmetic progression and the number of triangles that satisfy the given condition?\n7. Are there any upper or lower bounds on the common difference that restrict the number of possible triangles? Why or why not?\n8. How would the number of triangles change if we allowed the degree measures to be negative or non-integer values?"
