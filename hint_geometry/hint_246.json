How can we find the value of $LN$ using the given information about $\\sin N$?\n3. What does it mean for $\\sin N$ to be equal to $\\frac{2}{3}$? How does this relate to the triangle in the diagram?\n4. How can we use the relationship between $\\sin N$, $LM$, and $LN$ to find the value of $LN$?\n5. What is $\\frac{LM}{LN}$ equal to? How can we use this to solve for $LN$?\n6. Can you explain why $\\frac{16}{LN} = \\frac{2}{3}$? What property or rule allows us to set up this equation?\n7. What is the value of $LN$? How did you calculate it using the given equation?\n8. Can you think of any other trigonometric relationships that could be used to solve for lengths or angles in similar diagrams?"
