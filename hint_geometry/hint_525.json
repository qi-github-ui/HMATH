How can we find the area of the base $[ABCD]$? What do we know about the sides of the rectangle?\n4. What is the height of the pyramid? How do we know this?\n5. How can we use the area of the base and the height to find the volume of the pyramid? What is the formula for the volume of a pyramid?\n6. Can you calculate the volume of the pyramid using the given values?"
