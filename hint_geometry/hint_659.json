    "problem": "Parallelogram $ABCD$ with $A(2,5)$, $B(4,9)$, $C(6,5)$, and $D(4,1)$ is reflected across the $x$-axis to $A'B'C'D'$ and then $A'B'C'D'$ is reflected across the line $y=x+1$ to $A''B''C''D''$. This is done such that $D'$ is the image of $D$, and $D''$ is the image of $D'$. What is the ordered pair of $D''$ in the coordinate plane?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Reflecting a point across the $x$-axis multiplies its $y$-coordinate by $-1$.  Therefore, $D'=(4,-1)$.  To reflect $D'$ across the line $y=x+1$, we first translate both the line and the point down one unit so that the equation of the translated line is $y=x$ and the coordinates of the translated point are $(4,-2)$.  To reflect across $y=x$, we switch the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate to obtain $(-2,4)$.  Translating this point one unit up, we find that $D''=\\boxed{(-2,5)}$.",
