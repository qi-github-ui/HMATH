    "solution": "We look at $\\angle ABC$. $\\angle ABC$ cuts off minor arc $\\widehat{AC}$, which has measure $2\\cdot m\\angle ABC = 150^\\circ$, so minor arcs $\\widehat{AB}$ and $\\widehat{BC}$ each have measure $\\frac{360^\\circ-150^\\circ}{2}=105^\\circ$.\n\nStuart cuts off one $105^\\circ$ minor arc with each segment he draws.  By the time Stuart comes all the way around to his starting point and has drawn, say, $n$ segments, he will have created $n$ $105^\\circ$ minor arcs which can be pieced together to form a whole number of full circles, say, $m$ circles.  Let there be $m$ full circles with total arc measure $360^\\circ \\cdot m$.  Then we have \\[105^\\circ \\cdot n = 360^\\circ \\cdot m.\\]  We want to find the smallest integer $n$ for which there is an integer solution $m$.  Dividing both sides of the equation by $15^\\circ$ gives $7n=24m$; thus, we see $n=24$ works (in which case $m=7$).  The answer is $\\boxed{24}$ segments.",
