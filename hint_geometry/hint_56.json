    "problem": "If a triangle has two sides of lengths 5 and 7 units, then how many different integer lengths can the third side be?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the length of the third side.  Then by the triangle inequality, \\begin{align*}\nn + 5 &> 7, \\\\\nn + 7 &> 5, \\\\\n5 + 7 &> n,\n\\end{align*} which tell us that $n > 2$, $n > -2$, and $n < 12$.  Hence, the possible values of $n$ are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, for a total of $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem using the given information?\n2. How can the triangle inequality help us determine the possible lengths of the third side?\n3. What are the specific inequalities we can write based on the triangle inequality theorem for this problem?\n4. What do these inequalities tell us about the possible values for the length of the third side?\n5. How can we use these inequalities to find the range of integer lengths for the third side?\n6. What is the final answer to the question?"
