    "problem": "The diagonals of a regular hexagon have two possible lengths. What is the ratio of the shorter length to the longer length? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.",

    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The two possible diagonal lengths are $AB$ and $AC$.  The measure of an interior angle of a regular hexagon is $180(6-2)/6=120$ degrees. Therefore, angle $BCA$ measures $120/2=60$ degrees.  Also, the base angles of the isosceles triangle with the marked 120-degree angle each measure $(180-120)/2=30$ degrees. This implies that $\\angle CBA$ is a right angle, so triangle $ABC$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.  Therefore, the ratio of $AB$ to $AC$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.
