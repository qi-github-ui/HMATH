    "problem": "A rectangular box has interior dimensions 6-inches by 5-inches by 10-inches. The box is filled with as many solid 3-inch cubes as possible, with all of the cubes entirely inside the rectangular box. What percent of the volume of the box is taken up by the cubes?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Three-inch cubes can fill a rectangular box only if the edge lengths of the box are all integer multiples of 3 inches.  The largest such box whose dimensions are less than or equal to those of the $6''\\times5''\\times10''$ box is a $6''\\times3''\\times9''$ box.  The ratio of the volumes of these two boxes is  \\[\n\\frac{6\\cdot3\\cdot9}{6\\cdot5\\cdot10}=\\frac{3\\cdot9}{5\\cdot10}=\\frac{27}{50},\n\\] which is $\\boxed{54}$ percent.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. What are the different methods you know for finding the volume of a rectangular box?\n3. How do you determine the maximum number of solid 3-inch cubes that can fit inside the given rectangular box?\n4. Why is it necessary for the edge lengths of the box to be integer multiples of 3 inches for the cubes to fit?\n5. Can you find the dimensions of the largest box that can be filled with 3-inch cubes given the interior dimensions of the rectangular box?\n6. What is the ratio of the volume of the largest box to the volume of the given rectangular box? How can you calculate it?\n7. How do you express the ratio as a percentage to find what percent of the volume is taken up by the cubes?"
