Since $\\tan Z = 7$, we have $XY = 7k$ and $XZ = k$ for some value of $k$, as shown in the diagram.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem gives $(7k)^2 + k^2 = 100^2$, so $50k^2 = 100^2$, which gives $k^2 = 100^2/50 = 200$.  Since $k$ must be positive, we have $k = \\sqrt{200} = 10\\sqrt{2}$, so $XY = 7k = \\boxed{70\\sqrt{2}}$.",
