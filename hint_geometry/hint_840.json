    "solution": "Draw a diagonal of the rectangle.  By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the diagonal is $\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$ centimeters.  Also, by symmetry the diagonal of the rectangle is a diameter of the circle.  The circumference of the circle is $\\pi\\times (\\text{diameter})=\\boxed{10\\pi}$ centimeters.
