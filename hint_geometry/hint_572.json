    "problem": "How many non-congruent triangles with only integer side lengths have a perimeter of 15 units?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "In a triangle, the lengths of any two sides must add up to a value larger than the third length's side.  This is known as the Triangle Inequality.  Keeping this in mind, we list out cases based on the length of the shortest side.\n\nCase 1:  shortest side has length $1$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $7$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{1,7,7\\}$.\n\nCase 2:  shortest side has length $2$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $6$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{2,6,7\\}$.\n\nCase 3:  shortest side has length $3$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $6$ and $6$ or $5$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{3,6,6\\}$ and $\\{3,5,7\\}$.\n\nCase 4:  shortest side has length $4$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $5$ and $6$ or $4$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{4,5,6\\}$ and $\\{4,4,7\\}$.\n\nCase 5:  shortest side has length $5$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $5$ and $5$.  This leads to the set $\\{5,5,5\\}$.\n\nHence there are $\\boxed{7}$ sets of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of $15$ units.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the Triangle Inequality and why is it important in this problem?\n2. How many cases are there to consider when determining the number of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of 15 units? \n3. Can you explain the reasoning behind the sets of side lengths listed in each case? \n4. How do we know that the triangles in each set are non-congruent? \n5. Can you think of another method to determine the number of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of 15 units? \n6. What is the difference between a congruent triangle and a non-congruent triangle? \n7. Is it possible to have non-integer side lengths in a triangle with a perimeter of 15 units? Why or why not?"
