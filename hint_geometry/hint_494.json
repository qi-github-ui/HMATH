The area of right triangle $ABT$ is $(12)(12)/2 = 72$ square units, so the volume of the pyramid is $\\frac13([ABT])(CT) = \\frac13(72)(6) = 144$ cubic units.\n\nLetting the distance from $T$ to face $ABC$ be $h$, the volume of $TABC$ can also be expressed as $\\frac{h}{3}([ABC])$, so $\\frac{h}{3}([ABC]) = 144$, from which we have \\[h = \\frac{432}{[ABC]}.\\]Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangles $TAB$, $TAC$, and $TBC$, we have \\begin{align*}\nAB&= 12\\sqrt{2},\\\\\nAC &= BC = \\sqrt{12^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{6^2(2^2 + 1^2)} = 6\\sqrt{5}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles.  Altitude $\\overline{CM}$ of $\\triangle ABC$ bisects $\\overline{AB}$, so we have $AM = 6\\sqrt{2}$.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to $\\triangle ACM$ gives us $CM = 6\\sqrt{3}$, so \\[[ABC] = \\frac{(AB)(CM)}{2} = 36\\sqrt{6}.\\]Substituting this into our equation for $h$ above, we have \\[h = \\frac{432}{[ABC]} = \\frac{432}{36\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{36\\cdot 12}{36\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{6}}.\\]",
