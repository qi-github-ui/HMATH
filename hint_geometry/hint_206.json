    "solution": "Because triangles $D$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{AE}$, $ABEC$ must be a parallelogram, so $AB=CE=11$. Then because triangle $ABC$ is isosceles, $BC=AB=11$. That means $BD=\n\\frac{11}{2}$ or $\\boxed{5.5}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the given triangle $ABC$ and its properties? \n2. What do we know about point $D$ and how does it relate to the triangle $ABC$? \n3. How can we use the fact that $\\overline{CE}$ is 11 units long to find the length of $\\overline{BC}$? \n4. What is the relationship between the length of $\\overline{BC}$ and the length of $\\overline{BD}$? \n5. How can we use the information about point $D$ to find the length of $\\overline{BD}$? \n6. Can we check our answer to ensure that it is correct? If so, how can we check? \n7. If $\\overline{CE}$ was a different length, would our approach to finding the length of $\\overline{BD}$ change? Why or why not? \n8. How does our solution to this problem relate to the properties of isosceles triangles and midpoints?"
