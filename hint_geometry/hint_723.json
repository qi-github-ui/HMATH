So, the area of the base equals 6 times the area of an equilateral triangle with side length 4.  An equilateral triangle with side length 4 has area $4^2\\sqrt{3}/4 = 4\\sqrt{3}$, so the area of the base of the pyramid is $6(4\\sqrt{3}) = 24\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nLet $O$ be the center of the hexagon, so $\\overline{PO}$ is the altitude from the apex of the pyramid.  Since triangle $PAD$ is an equilateral triangle, triangle $POA$ is a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse 8.  $\\overline{PO}$ is opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle in this triangle, so $PO = 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFinally, the volume of the pyramid is  \\[\\frac13\\cdot [ABCDEF] \\cdot PO = \\frac13\\cdot 24\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 4\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{96}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is a regular hexagon and how is it different from a regular triangle or square?\n2. How does drawing the long diagonals of a regular hexagon help us find the area of the base of the pyramid?\n3. Why do we multiply the area of one equilateral triangle by 6 to find the area of the entire regular hexagon?\n4. How do we know that triangle $POA$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and what is the length of its legs?\n5. How do we use the knowledge of the length of $\\overline{PO}$ and the area of the base to find the volume of the pyramid?\n6. What other shapes can be used to form the base of a pyramid, and how does finding the area of the base differ for each shape?"
