What are the lengths of the two sides adjacent to angle $Y$?\n4. How can we use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the remaining side?\n5. What is the formula for tangent and how does it relate to the sides of a right triangle?\n6. How can we use the lengths we found to determine $\\tan Y$?\n7. Can you simplify the expression for $\\tan Y$?\n8. Can you think of any other ways to find the value of $\\tan Y$ in this triangle?\n9. How does the value of $\\tan Y$ relate to the angles and sides of the triangle?"
