    "solution": "The $y$-intercept of the line $y = -\\frac{3}{4}x+9$ is $y=9$, so $Q$ has coordinates $(0, 9)$.\n\nTo determine the $x$-intercept, we set $y=0$, and so obtain $0 = -\\frac{3}{4}x+9$ or $\\frac{3}{4}x=9$ or $x=12$.  Thus, $P$ has coordinates $(12, 0)$.\n\nTherefore, the area of $\\triangle POQ$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(12)(9) = 54$, since $\\triangle POQ$ is right-angled at $O$.\n\nSince we would like the area of $\\triangle TOP$ to be one third that of $\\triangle POQ$, then the area of $\\triangle TOP$ should be 18.\n\nIf $T$ has coordinates $(r, s)$, then $\\triangle TOP$ has base $OP$ of length 12 and height $s$, so $\\frac{1}{2}(12)(s)=18$ or $6s=18$ or $s=3$.\n\nSince $T$ lies on the line, then $s = -\\frac{3}{4}r+9$ or $3=-\\frac{3}{4}r+9$ or $\\frac{3}{4}r=6$ or $r=8$.\n\nThus, $r+s=8+3=\\boxed{11}$.",
