    "solution": "$BG$ is a diagonal along one face of the cube. Since this diagonal splits the square face into two $45-45-90$ triangles, the diagonal is $\\sqrt{2}$ times longer than a side of the square, so a side of the square measures $5\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2}=5$ units. Thus, the volume of the cube is $5^3=\\boxed{125}$ cubic units.",
