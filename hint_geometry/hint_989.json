    "solution": "[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1.4142));\ndraw((1,1)--(1,-1)--(-1,-1)--(-1,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0.2,1)--(0.2,1.4)--(-0.2,1.4)--(-0.2,1));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,1.4),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0.2,1.4),NE);\ndot((0,0)); dot((0,1.4)); dot((0.2,1.4));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,1.4)--(0.2,1.4)--cycle,red);\n[/asy]\n\nWe label the points as shown.  $A$ is the midpoint of the top side of the square, and $B$ is a vertex of the square.  We look at right triangle $\\triangle OAB$.  We seek a ratio of areas, which remains constant no matter the side lengths, so for simplicity, we let the big square have side length $2$ and the small square have side length $2x$.  Then, $OA=1+2x$, $AB=x$, and $OB$ is a radius of the circle, which has length $\\sqrt{2}$ by 45-45-90 triangles.  Then, the Pythagorean theorem states that $OA^2+AB^2=OB^2$, or \\[(1+2x)^2 + x^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2.\\]   Simplifying the equation yields \\begin{align*}\n& 1+4x+4x^2 + x^2 = 2 \\\\\n\\Longleftrightarrow\\ & 5x^2 + 4x-1 =0 \\\\\n\\Longleftrightarrow\\ & (5x-1)(x+1).\n\\end{align*} Thus, $x=-1$ or $x=1/5$.  Lengths are clearly positive, so the valid solution is $x=1/5$.  Then the small square has side length $2x=2/5$, and area $(2/5)^2 = 4/25$.  The large square has area $2^2=4$, so the small square has \\[\\frac{4/25}{4}=1/25=\\boxed{4\\%}\\] the area of the large square.",

Can you identify any specific points or lines of the larger square that intersect with the smaller square?\n3. How does the positioning of the smaller square within the larger square affect their dimensions?\n4. What information can you gather from the labeled points A and B? How does this relate to the lengths of the sides of the squares?\n5. Let's consider the right triangle OAB. How can the Pythagorean theorem be applied to this triangle?\n6. Can we express the side lengths of the squares and the radius of the circle in terms of x? What equation can be formed using the Pythagorean theorem?\n7. How can we simplify and solve this equation to find the possible values for x?\n8. Are there any restrictions or considerations for the value of x in terms of lengths?\n9. If we find a solution for x, what does it represent in terms of the side length of the smaller square?\n10. How can we calculate the area of the smaller square using the found value of x?\n11. By comparing the areas of the smaller and larger squares, what conclusion can we draw about the percent of the smaller square's area relative to the larger square's area?"
