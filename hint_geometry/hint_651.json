    "problem": "A pipe with inside diameter 10'' is to carry water from a reservoir to a small town in an arid land. Neglecting the friction and turbulence of the water against the inside of the pipes, what is the minimum number of 2''-inside-diameter pipes of the same length needed to carry the same volume of water to the arid town?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the length of the pipes be $h$.  The volume of the 10-inch pipe is $\\pi (5^2) (h) = 25\\pi h$ cubic inches and the volume of each 2-inch pipe is $\\pi (1^2)(h) = \\pi h$ cubic inches.  Hence we see it takes exactly 25 2-inch pipes to match the volume of one 10-inch pipe.  The answer is $\\boxed{25}$ pipes.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you calculate the volume of a 10-inch pipe? \n2. What information do you need to determine the number of 2-inch pipes needed to match the volume of one 10-inch pipe? \n3. What is the formula for calculating the volume of a 2-inch pipe? \n4. How do you compare the volumes of a 10-inch pipe and a 2-inch pipe? \n5. Why is it necessary to neglect friction and turbulence in this problem? \n6. What other factors could affect the number of 2-inch pipes needed in this scenario?"
