    "solution": "The base of the hemisphere is a circle with radius 6 and area $6^2\\pi=36\\pi$.  The curved top of the hemisphere has half the surface area of a full sphere, which has surface area $4\\pi(6^2)=144\\pi$, so the curved top of the hemisphere has $144\\pi/2=72\\pi$.  The total surface area of the hemisphere is $36\\pi+72\\pi=\\boxed{108\\pi}$.",

What is the formula for calculating the surface area of a full sphere?\n4. How can we find the surface area of the curved top of the hemisphere?\n5. How do we obtain the surface area of the curved top if we only have the surface area of a full sphere?\n6. What is the relationship between the surface area of the curved top and the surface area of a full sphere?\n7. What is the total surface area of the hemisphere? How did you arrive at that answer?\n8. Can you express the total surface area of the hemisphere in terms of pi?\n9. Are there any other ways to find the total surface area of a hemisphere? If so, what are they?\n10. Can you think of any other geometric shapes where we might need to calculate the total surface area using similar reasoning and steps?"
