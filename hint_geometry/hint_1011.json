Therefore, we have $\\sin 510^\\circ = \\sin (510^\\circ - 360^\\circ) = \\sin 150^\\circ$.\n\nLet $P$ be the point on the unit circle that is $150^\\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the $x$-axis, as shown below.\n\n[asy]\npair A,C,P,O,D;\ndraw((0,-1.2)--(0,1.2),p=black+1.2bp,Arrows(0.15cm));\ndraw((-1.2,0)--(1.2,0),p=black+1.2bp,Arrows(0.15cm));\nA = (1,0);\nO= (0,0);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(1.2,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,1.2),NE);\n\nP = rotate(150)*A;\nD = foot(P,A,-A);\ndraw(O--P--D);\ndraw(rightanglemark(O,D,P,2));\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,SE);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,NW);\n//label(\"$A$\",A,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\n[/asy]\n\nTriangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $DO = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $DP = \\frac12$.  Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac12\\right)$, so $\\sin 510^\\circ = \\sin 150^\\circ = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem? \n2. How does rotating $360^\\circ$ relate to doing nothing? How does that help us figure out $\\sin 510^\\circ$? \n3. What is the relationship between rotating $510^\\circ$ and rotating $150^\\circ$? \n4. Why did we choose the point $P$ to be $150^\\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$? \n5. How do we know that triangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle? \n6. What are the coordinates of point $P$? How does that help us find $\\sin 510^\\circ$?"
