    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the properties of the incircle in a triangle? In what ways is it different from the circumcircle?\n2. How does knowing the angles of the triangle help us determine the angle measures in smaller triangles formed by the points of contact of the incircle?\n3. What can we conclude about triangle XYZ if circle \u0393 is both its incircle and circumcircle?\n4. How can we determine the angle measure AYX based on the given information?\n5. Are there any special relationships between the angles in triangle XYZ that can help us find the measure of AYX?\n6. Can you think of any other properties or relationships in geometry that could be helpful in solving this problem?"
