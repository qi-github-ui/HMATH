    "solution": "The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the point with its image under the reflection.  The slope of the segment is $\\frac{3-(-1)}{5-(-3)}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Since the line of reflection is perpendicular, its slope, $m$, equals $-2$.  By the midpoint formula, the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment is $\\left(\\frac{5-3}2,\\frac{3-1}2\\right)=(1,1)$.   Since the line of reflection goes through this point, we have $1=(-2)(1)+b$, and so $b=3$.  Thus $m+b=\\boxed{1}.$",
