    "problem": "A day can be evenly divided into 86,400 periods of 1 second; 43,200 periods of each 2 seconds; or in many other ways. In total, how many ways are there to divide a day into $n$ periods of $m$ seconds, where $n$ and $m$ are positive integers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "A day has $86,\\!400$ seconds. $86,\\!400=2^7\\cdot3^3\\cdot5^2$, so 86,400 has $(7+1)(3+1)(2+1)=96$ positive factors. Thus there are $96/2=48$ (unordered) pairs of factors each of whose product is $86,\\!400.$ Since ``$n$ periods of $m$ seconds'' is different from ``$m$ periods of $n$ seconds,'' we need to multiply $48$ by $2$ to get our final answer of $\\boxed{96}$ ways.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem we are trying to solve? \n2. How is a day divided into different periods of time? \n3. What is the relationship between the number of periods and the length of each period? \n4. How can we express the problem mathematically in terms of $n$ and $m$? \n5. What are the divisors of 86,400? How do we find them? \n6. How many pairs of divisors of 86,400 can be multiplied to get 86,400? \n7. Why do we need to multiply the number of pairs by 2? \n8. How do we get the final answer of 96 ways to divide a day into $n$ periods of $m$ seconds? \n9. Can we generalize this problem to other time intervals and periods? \n10. What other insights or observations can we make from this problem?"
