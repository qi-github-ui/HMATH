    "problem": "For how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 120 inclusive does the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{120}$ terminate?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $3$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{120-1}{3} \\right\\rfloor+1=40$ multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $120$, so there are $\\boxed{40}$ integers values for $n$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what is meant by the decimal representation of a fraction?\n2. According to the given statement, when does the decimal representation of a fraction terminate?\n3. What is the prime factorization of 120?\n4. Based on the given statement, what must be true for the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{120}$ to terminate?\n5. How many factors of 3 are there between 1 and 120?\n6. How many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 120 inclusive satisfy the condition that the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{120}$ terminates? \n7. Can you generalize this problem to find the number of integer values of $n$ between 1 and $k$ inclusive that satisfy the same condition, where $k$ is any positive integer?"
