    "problem": "A book has 136 pages. Each page has the same number of words, and each page has no more than 100 words on it. The number of words in the book is congruent to 184, modulo 203. How many words are on each page?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If there are $p$ words on each page, then we are given $136p \\equiv 184 \\pmod{203}$. We can divide both sides of the congruence by 8 since 8 is relatively prime to 203, and this yields $17p \\equiv 23 \\pmod{203}$. Checking integers which are 1 more than multiples of 203, we find that the modular inverse of 17 modulo 203 is 12. Therefore, $p \\equiv 12(23) \\equiv 73 \\pmod{203}$. Therefore, each page has $\\boxed{73}$ words on it.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the problem statement in your own words?\n2. What is the meaning of \"congruent to 184, modulo 203\"? How does it relate to the number of words in the book?\n3. How can we represent the number of words on each page using a variable?\n4. By dividing both sides of the congruence by 8, what do we achieve? Why can we do this step?\n5. What is the modular inverse? How does it help in finding the value of $p$?\n6. Can you explain why we check integers that are 1 more than multiples of 203?\n7. How did we determine that the modular inverse of 17 modulo 203 is 12?\n8. After finding the modular inverse, how do we find the value of $p$?\n9. How can we confirm that our final answer is correct using the congruence equation?\n10. Can you think of any other problems or situations where modular arithmetic can be applied in a similar way?"
