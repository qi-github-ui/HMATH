    "problem": "An arithmetic sequence with first term $1$ has a common difference of $6$. A second sequence begins with $4$ and has a common difference of $7$. In the range of $1$ to $100$, what is the largest number common to both sequences?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the smallest common term. We know that \\begin{align*}\na & \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6\\\\\na & \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} We see that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=1+6n$. Substituting this into $a \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7$ yields \\[1+6n\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\implies n\\equiv 4\\pmod 7\\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $4$. Then $n\\ge 4\\implies a=1+6n\\ge 25$. We see that $25$ satisfies both congruences so $a=25$. If $b$ is any common term, subtracting $25$ from both sides of both congruences gives \\begin{align*}\nb-25 & \\equiv -24\\equiv 0\\pmod 6 \\\\\nb-25 & \\equiv -21\\equiv 0\\pmod 7\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(6,7)=1$, we have $b-25\\equiv 0\\pmod {6\\cdot 7}$, that is, $b\\equiv 25\\pmod{42}.$ So $b=25+42m$ for some integer $m$. The largest such number less than $100$ is $\\boxed{67}$, which happens to satisfies the original congruences.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what an arithmetic sequence is? How would you define it?\n2. Given the first term and common difference of an arithmetic sequence, how would you find the nth term of the sequence?\n3. Let's consider the first arithmetic sequence with a first term of 1 and a common difference of 6. What are the first few terms of this sequence? Can you find a pattern?\n4. Now let's focus on the second arithmetic sequence with a first term of 4 and a common difference of 7. What are the first few terms of this sequence? Can you find a pattern here as well?\n5. How would you determine the common terms between these two sequences? What is the condition that needs to be satisfied for a number to be a common term?\n6. Let's use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve the congruence equations: 1 mod 6 and 4 mod 7. Can you explain the steps involved in finding the smallest common term?\n7. If we find the smallest common term, can we determine the other common terms in the two sequences? How would you go about doing that?\n8. In the given range from 1 to 100, how can we find the largest number that satisfies both sequences? Is there a systematic approach we can use?\n9. Can you determine a general formula to find the largest common term between any two arithmetic sequences? How would you prove its correctness?\n10. Can you think of other scenarios where the concept of arithmetic sequences and finding common terms might be useful?"
