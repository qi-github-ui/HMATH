    "problem": "Alex is at the candy store buying jellybeans. He wants to buy at least 100 jellybeans. He wants to buy the least amount such that he would have exactly $11$ leftover after dividing the jellybeans evenly among $13$ people. How many jellybeans should Alex buy?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Alex wants a remainder of $11$ after he divides the number of jellybeans he buys by $13$. When you divide $100$ by $13$, you get $7$ with a remainder of $9$. Since Alex wants $11$ jellybeans left over, he should buy $11-9=2$ more than $100$. Therefore, he should buy $100+2=\\boxed{102}$ jellybeans.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the minimum number of jellybeans that Alex wants to buy? \n2. Why does Alex want to have a remainder of 11 after dividing by 13?\n3. How did we determine that the remainder of 100 divided by 13 is 9?\n4. What does it mean when we say Alex should buy \"2 more than 100\" jellybeans?\n5. Can you explain why the number of jellybeans Alex buys should be 102 based on the given information? \n6. Are there any other possible solutions for the number of jellybeans Alex should buy in order to satisfy the given conditions?"
