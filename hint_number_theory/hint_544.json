    "problem": "When Claire divides her cupcakes into groups of 5, she has 3 remaining, and when she divides her cupcakes into groups of 7, she has 4 remaining. If Claire has fewer than 60 cupcakes, what is the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes that she could have?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If Claire has $N$ cupcakes, we know that $N = 5x+3$ and $N = 7y+4$ for some integers $x$ and $y$. Equating these two forms of $N$, we have $7y+1=5x$. We also know that $N<60$. We can write out all the sufficiently small possible values of $7y+1$: $$1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57.$$Of these, the numbers that are also of the form $5x$ are $15$ and $50$. These correspond to solutions $N=18,$ $N=53$. Thus, the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes is $53+18 = \\boxed{71}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the given conditions for the number of cupcakes Claire has?\n2. Can you write an equation that relates the number of cupcakes Claire has, with the conditions given in the problem?\n3. How can you use the equation to find the possible values of the number of cupcakes Claire has?\n4. What does it mean when we say that $N$ is of the form $5x$ or $7y+1$?\n5. Why are we only considering the values of $7y+1$ that are less than $60$?\n6. How did you determine that the only possible values for $N$ are 18 and 53?\n7. What is the sum of all possible quantities of cupcakes Claire could have?"
