    "problem": "On a $12$-hour clock, an elapsed time of four hours looks the same as an elapsed time of $16$ hours. Because of this, we can say that four hours is \"clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours. What is the least whole number of hours that is greater than $4$ hours and is \"clock equivalent'' to its square number of hours?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For two times to be clock equivalent, their difference must be a multiple of $12.$ We list the hours greater than $4,$ their squares, and the differences between them:  \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n5 & 25 & 20\\\\\n6 & 36 & 30\\\\\n7 & 49 & 42\\\\\n8 & 64 & 56\\\\\n9 & 81 & 72\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular} We can stop at $\\boxed{9},$ since it is the smallest hour greater than $4$ that is clock equivalent to $81,$ its square.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean for two times to be \"clock equivalent\" on a 12-hour clock? \n2. How can we use the fact that elapsed times of 4 hours and 16 hours are clock equivalent to determine that 4 hours is clock equivalent to its square number of hours? \n3. Can you explain why the difference between two clock equivalent times must be a multiple of 12? \n4. Using the table of hours, squares, and differences, can you identify the smallest hour greater than 4 that is clock equivalent to its square number of hours? \n5. How do we know that we can stop at 9 as the smallest hour that satisfies the conditions? \n6. Can you provide other examples where the concept of clock equivalence can be applied?"
