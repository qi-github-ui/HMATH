    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the desired number. We know that \\begin{align*}\na & \\equiv 0\\pmod 2\\\\\na & \\equiv 1\\pmod 3\\\\\na & \\equiv 2\\pmod 4\n\\end{align*} Note that $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ automatically implies $a \\equiv 0\\pmod 2$, so only $a \\equiv 1\\pmod 3$ and $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ need to be considered. The first few positive solutions of $a \\equiv 2\\pmod 4$ are $2,6,10$. While the first two do not satisfy $a \\equiv 1\\pmod 3$, luckily $\\boxed{10}$ does!",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for a number to have a remainder when divided by another number?\n2. How can we use the given remainders to set up congruence equations for the unknown number?\n3. Let's focus on the congruence equation $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. Can you find the first few positive solutions that satisfy this congruence?\n4. Now let's consider the congruence equation $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. Can you find the first few positive solutions that satisfy this congruence?\n5. Do any of the solutions from the previous step satisfy both congruences simultaneously?\n6. What is the least positive integer that satisfies both congruences?"
