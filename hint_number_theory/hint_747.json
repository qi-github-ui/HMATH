    "problem": "Given that $x$ is a multiple of $23478$, what is the greatest common divisor of $f(x)=(2x+3)(7x+2)(13x+7)(x+13)$ and $x$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "In $f(x)$, all terms will have a multiple of $x$ except for the constant term, which is the multiple of the four constants $3,2,7$, and $13$.\n\nRecall (from the Euclidean algorithm) that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $a-kb$ where $k,a,$ and $b$ are any integers. Therefore, finding the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is the same as finding the greatest common divisor of $x$ and the constant term of $f(x)$. Therefore, we want to find \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,((2x+3)(7x+2)(13x+7)(x+13),x) &=\\text{gcd}\\,(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 13, x)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(546,x).\n\\end{align*}Since $23478$ is a multiple of $546$, the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is $\\boxed{546}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the constant term in the expression $f(x) = (2x+3)(7x+2)(13x+7)(x+13)$?\n2. What is the relationship between the greatest common divisor of two numbers and the greatest common divisor of one of the numbers and their difference?\n3. What is the greatest common divisor of $546$ and $x$?\n4. How can we use the fact that $x$ is a multiple of $23478$ to find the greatest common divisor between $f(x)$ and $x$?\n5. Can you explain why finding the greatest common divisor between $f(x)$ and $x$ is the same as finding the greatest common divisor between $x$ and the constant term of $f(x)$?\n6. Are there any other examples or situations where we can use a similar approach to find the greatest common divisor?"
