    "problem": "How many ways can 1995 be factored as a product of two two-digit numbers? (Two factorizations of the form $a\\cdot b$ and $b\\cdot a$ are considered the same).",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "$1995=5\\cdot399=3\\cdot5\\cdot133=3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot19$. Since $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=105$ has three digits, in any expression of $1995$ as the product of two two-digit numbers, $19$ must be a proper factor of one of them. $19\\cdot3=57$ and $19\\cdot5=95$ are two-digit numbers that are divisible by $19$ and divide $1995$, but $19\\cdot7=133$ and $19\\cdot3\\cdot5=285$ are three digits, so the only possible expressions of $1995$ as the product of two two-digit numbers are $57\\cdot35$ and $95\\cdot21$. So, there are $\\boxed{2}$ such factorizations.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the prime factorization of 1995?\n2. How many two-digit numbers are divisible by 19 and can be multiplied with another two-digit number to get 1995?\n3. Are there any two-digit numbers that are factors of 1995 and cannot be paired with another two-digit number to get 1995? If so, why?\n4. Can 1995 be factored into the product of three two-digit numbers? If not, why not?\n5. Would the answer be different if we allowed the factorizations to be in the form of $a\\cdot b$ and $b\\cdot a$ separately? Why or why not? \n6. Can the same method be used to find the number of ways a different integer can be factored into the product of two two-digit numbers? If so, how would the process differ?"
