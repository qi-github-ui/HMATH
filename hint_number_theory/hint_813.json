    "problem": "What is the sum of all positive integer solutions less than or equal to $20$ to the congruence $13(3x-2)\\equiv 26\\pmod 8$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We can simplify as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n13(3x-2)&\\equiv 26 &\\pmod 8\\\\\n3x-2&\\equiv 2 &\\pmod 8\\\\\n3x&\\equiv 4 &\\pmod 8\\\\\n9x&\\equiv 4\\cdot 3 &\\pmod 8\\\\\nx&\\equiv 12 &\\pmod 8\\\\\nx&\\equiv 4 &\\pmod 8\n\\end{align*}So $x=4+8n$ is a solution for all $n$ and all solutions are of this form. The solutions in the range $0<x\\le 20$ are $4,12,20$, so their sum is $4+12+20=\\boxed{36}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step to solve the congruence $13(3x-2)\\equiv 26\\pmod 8$?\n2. Can you explain the process of simplifying the congruence and obtaining $x\\equiv 4\\pmod 8$?\n3. How did you determine that $x=4+8n$ is a solution for all $n$?\n4. How did you find the range of solutions $0<x\\le 20$?\n5. What are the positive integer solutions in that range?\n6. What is the sum of those solutions?"
