    "problem": "You have a number of gold coins that you were going to distribute equally among your 11 best friends. However, after dividing your gold coins into 11 equal piles, you realize that if you give away all your gold coins, 2 people will receive an extra gold coin. You have less than 100 gold coins. What is the largest number of gold coins you could have to cause this to happen?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If the two people received one fewer coin, then the number of gold coins you would have would be a multiple of 11. However, there are two extra coins there, so the number of gold coins you have can be written in the form $11k+2$. We have that $11k+2 < 100$, so $k < \\frac{98}{11}$. Since $k$ is the number of gold coins each person is receiving, $k$ must be an integer, so we have that $k = 8$. Therefore, the largest number of gold coins you could have is $11(8) + 2 = \\boxed{90}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the problem statement in your own words? \n2. What is the equation that represents the problem? \n3. How did you come up with the expression $11k+2$ to represent the number of gold coins? \n4. How did you use the fact that the number of gold coins is less than 100 to solve the problem? \n5. Why did you set $k$ equal to 8? \n6. How did you arrive at the final answer of 90? \n7. Is there a different way to approach this problem? If so, can you explain it? \n8. Can you think of a similar problem that involves distributing a certain number of items equally among a group of people?"
