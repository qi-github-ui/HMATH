    "problem": "How many two-digit numbers can be written in the form $2^n$ where $n$ is an integer?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The smallest $n$ that works is $4$ with $2^4=16$ and the largest is $6$ with $2^6=64,$ so $n$ can be $4,\\ 5,$ or $6$ for $\\boxed{3}$ such numbers.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the form $2^n$ means in this context?\n2. What is the smallest possible value of $n$ that results in a two-digit number when $2^n$ is calculated? Why?\n3. On the other hand, what is the largest possible value of $n$ that results in a two-digit number? Why?\n4. Can you determine any other values of $n$ that would result in a two-digit number? If so, what are they and why do they work?\n5. How many different values of $n$ did you find that satisfy the condition? Can you list them?\n6. Can you think of any other similar problems where the same kind of thinking and steps would be needed to find the solution?"
