    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Marcus has two equations: \\[a=45n+37\\]and \\[b=30m+9.\\]When he adds these he gets \\[a+b=45n+30m+37+9=15(3n+2m)+46=15(3n+2m+3)+1.\\]The remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15 is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. To find the remainder when dividing $a+b$ by 15, what is the first step you would take?\n2. Can you describe any strategies or methods you know that can help find the remainder in this type of problem?\n3. If you were to work with the given equations, what information can you gather about the remainders of $a$ and $b$?\n4. How can you combine the equations for $a$ and $b$ to determine the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by 15?\n5. Can you explain why adding the equations gives you a multiple of 15 plus a remainder?\n6. Based on the equation you derived, what can you conclude about the remainder when dividing $a+b$ by 15? How can you prove this?"
