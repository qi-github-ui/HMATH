    "solution": "Let $b$ be the base in which the numbers in the square are expressed. The first row and the first column must have the same sum, which implies that $1+11_b = 4+3$. Writing $11_b$ as $b+1$, we find that $1+b+1 = 7$, which implies $b=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is a magic square? Can you provide a definition or explain its properties?\n2. How would you determine the sum of numbers in each row, column, and diagonal of a magic square? What approach could you use to find these sums?\n3. In the given magic square, what are the sums of the numbers in the first row and the first column? How can you express them in terms of the base, denoted by \"b\"?\n4. Based on the information given, what equation can we write to represent the sum of the numbers in the first row and the first column? Can you solve this equation for \"b\"?\n5. Assuming the number \"11_b\" can be represented as \"b+1\" in base 10, can you rewrite the equation from the previous step and solve for \"b\"?\n6. What value of \"b\" satisfies the equation and makes the sum of the numbers in the first row and the first column equal?\n7. Based on your findings, in what base will the given magic square be valid or considered a magic square? How did you arrive at this conclusion?"
