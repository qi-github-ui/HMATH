    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Setting up the terms in a descending order, the first column gives you a residue of $3$ and you carry over $2$. In the second column there is no residue but you carry over $2$. Finally, in the third column, the sum of $7$ gives you a residue of $1$ and you carry over $1$. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}&_{1}&_{2}&_{2}&\\\\&&5&5&5_6\\\\&&&5&5_6\\\\&+&&&5_6\\\\ \\cline{2-5} &1&1&0&3_6\\\\ \\end{array}$$Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{1103_6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in finding the sum of $555_6$, $55_6$, and $5_6$ in base $6$?\n2. What are the different columns you need to consider when adding these numbers in base $6$?\n3. How do you handle carrying over values from one column to the next in base $6$ addition?\n4. Why is it necessary to set up the terms in descending order before adding them in base $6$?\n5. What is the residue in each column after adding the numbers? How do you determine the digit for the sum and the carry-over?\n6. Can you think of other numbers or expressions where you would use a similar process of adding in base $6$?"
