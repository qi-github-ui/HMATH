    "problem": "Nine stones are arranged in a straight line. They are counted from  left to right as $1,2,3, \\ldots, 9$, and then from right to left, so that the stone previously counted as 8 is counted as 10. The pattern is continued to the left until the stone previously counted as 1 is counted as 17. The pattern then reverses so that the stone originally counted as 2 is counted as 18, 3 as 19, and so on. The counting continues in this manner. Which of the original stones is counted as 99? Express your answer as a single digit which corresponds to the first digit assigned to that stone.",

    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "First we note that 16 stones are enumerated before the pattern repeats.  Therefore, if the count enumerates a stone as $n$, then that stone is enumerated $k$ for every  \\[k\\equiv n\\pmod{16}\\] (though all but the end stones are represented by two residue classes in this way).\n\nSince $99\\equiv3\\pmod{16}$, stone number $\\boxed{3}$ is counted as 99.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain how the stones are arranged and counted in this problem?\n2. How many stones are there in total before the counting pattern repeats?\n3. How can we determine which stone is counted as a given number, based on the counting pattern?\n4. Can you find a pattern or rule that relates the number a stone is counted as to the original stone number?\n5. Given that stone number 3 is counted as 99, how can we use the pattern or rule to find this out?\n6. Is there a way we can generalize the pattern or rule to find which stone is counted as any given number?\n7. Can you think of any other numbers that you could use the pattern or rule to determine which stone they correspond to?"
