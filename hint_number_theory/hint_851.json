    "solution": "We use the property $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $ac \\equiv bc \\pmod{m}$.\n\nSince all numbers with the units digit of $2$ has a remainder of $2$ when divided by $5$ and we have $10$ numbers,  $$2 \\times 12 \\times 22 \\times 32 \\times \\ldots \\times 72 \\times 82 \\times 92 \\equiv 2^{10} \\equiv 1024 \\equiv \\boxed{4} \\pmod{5}.$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we represent the product $2 \\times 12 \\times 22 \\times 32 \\times \\ldots \\times 72 \\times 82 \\times 92$ more compactly using mathematical notation?\n2. Can you explain what it means for two numbers to be congruent modulo $5$?\n3. How can we use the property $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $ac \\equiv bc \\pmod{m}$ to simplify the expression $2 \\times 12 \\times 22 \\times 32 \\times \\ldots \\times 72 \\times 82 \\times 92$?\n4. What is the remainder when $2$ is divided by $5$? How does this relate to the remainder when numbers with a units digit of $2$ are divided by $5$?\n5. How many numbers are there that have a units digit of $2$ in the given product? Can we simplify this product using the congruence property mentioned earlier?\n6. What is the expanded form of $2^{10}$? How does this help us find the remainder when the given product is divided by $5$?\n7. Can you verify that the remainder of the given product divided by $5$ is indeed $4$ using the congruence property and the calculations we have made?"
