    "problem": "A relatively prime date is a date for which the number of the month and the number of the day are relatively prime. For example, June 17 is a relatively prime date because the greatest common factor of 6 and 17 is 1. How many relatively prime dates are in the month with the fewest relatively prime dates?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since exactly 1 in every $n$ consecutive dates is divisible by $n$, the month with the fewest relatively prime days is the month with the greatest number of distinct small prime divisors. This reasoning gives us June ($6=2\\cdot3$) and December ($12=2^2\\cdot3$). December, however, has one more relatively prime day, namely December 31, than does June, which has only 30 days. Therefore, June has the fewest relatively prime days. To count how many relatively prime days June has, we must count the number of days that are divisible neither by 2 nor by 3. Out of its 30 days, $\\frac{30}{2}=15$ are divisible by 2 and $\\frac{30}{3}=10$ are divisible by 3. We are double counting the number of days that are divisible by 6, $\\frac{30}{6}=5$ days. Thus, June has $30-(15+10-5)=30-20=\\boxed{10}$ relatively prime days.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a relatively prime date is in your own words?\n2. How can you determine if the month with the fewest relatively prime dates is the one with the greatest number of distinct small prime divisors?\n3. Why do we need to consider the divisibility of dates by certain small prime numbers to find the month with the fewest relatively prime dates?\n4. Can you explain why June and December are the two months being compared for having the fewest relatively prime dates? What are their respective factors?\n5. How can we calculate the number of days in June that are divisible by 2 and 3?\n6. Why do we need to subtract the days divisible by 6? Can you explain the double counting?\n7. Can you calculate the number of relatively prime days in June based on the given information?\n8. Can you think of any other months that might have a similar reasoning process for finding relatively prime dates?\n9. How can we generalize the process of finding relatively prime dates for any given month?\n10. What other interesting patterns or conclusions can you draw from this exploration of relatively prime dates?"
