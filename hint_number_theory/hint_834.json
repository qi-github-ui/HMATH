    "problem": "For a nonnegative integer $n$, let $r_9(n)$ stand for the remainder left when $n$ is divided by $9.$ For example, $r_9(25)=7.$\n\nWhat is the $22^{\\text{nd}}$ entry in an ordered list of all nonnegative integers $n$ that satisfy $$r_9(5n)\\le 4~?$$(Note that the first entry in this list is $0$.)",

    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The condition $r_9(5n)\\le 4$ can also be stated as $``5n\\equiv 0,1,2,3,\\text{ or }4\\pmod 9.\"$'\n\nWe can then restate that condition again by multiplying both sides by $2:$ $$10n \\equiv 0,2,4,6,\\text{ or }8\\pmod 9.$$This step is reversible (since $2$ has an inverse modulo $9$). Thus, it neither creates nor removes solutions. Moreover, the left side reduces to $n$ modulo $9,$ giving us the precise solution set $$n \\equiv 0,2,4,6,\\text{ or }8\\pmod 9.$$We wish to determine the $22^{\\text{nd}}$ nonnegative integer in this solution set. The first few solutions follow this pattern: $$\\begin{array}{c c c c c}\n0 & 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 \\\\\n9 & 11 & 13 & 15 & 17 \\\\\n18 & 20 & 22 & 24 & 26 \\\\\n27 & 29 & 31 & 33 & 35 \\\\\n36 & 38 & \\cdots\n\\end{array}$$The $22^{\\text{nd}}$ solution is $\\boxed{38}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. How can we use the condition $r_9(5n)\\le 4$ to rewrite the inequality using modular arithmetic?\n3. By multiplying both sides of the inequality by 2, what do we obtain and why is this step reversible?\n4. How can we express the solution set in terms of congruences modulo 9?\n5. Can you identify the pattern in the solution set and determine the 22nd nonnegative integer that satisfies the condition?\n6. Is there a general rule we can derive from this example that can be applied to similar problems in number theory?"
