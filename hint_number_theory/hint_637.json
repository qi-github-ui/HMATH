    "problem": "Every bag of Dummies (a chocolate candy) contains the same number of pieces.\n\nThe Dummies in one bag can't be divided equally among $9$ kids, because after each kid gets the same (whole) number of pieces, $7$ pieces are left over.\n\nIf the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, what is the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of Dummies in one bag. Then we know $n\\equiv 7\\pmod 9$, so $$3n\\equiv 3(7) = 21\\equiv 3\\pmod 9.$$Thus, when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among $9$ kids, there is a remainder of $\\boxed{3}$ leftover pieces.\n\nWe can also explain this solution without using modular arithmetic. Each bag can be divided equally among the $9$ kids with $7$ pieces from each bag left over. This makes $21$ leftover pieces, which are enough to give each kid $2$ more candies and have $3$ candies left over. Those last $3$ candies can't be divided equally among the kids, so the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find?\n2. Can you rephrase the problem statement in your own words?\n3. Let's define a variable to represent the number of Dummies in one bag. What variable would be appropriate here?\n4. What can we say about the remainder when we divide the number of Dummies in one bag by 9, based on the problem statement?\n5. Using the property we just discussed, what can we say about the remainder when we divide the number of Dummies in three bags by 9?\n6. How can we use the remainder to find the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over? \n7. Can you explain the solution without using modular arithmetic? \n8. What would happen to the solution if the number of bags were different or the number of kids were different? \n9. Can you think of any other similar problems that could be solved using similar techniques?"
