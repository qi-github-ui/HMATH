How many prime factors are there in 20! if we only consider primes less than 20?\n5. How do we know that 20! is divisible by every prime less than 20?\n6. Can we apply the same method to find the number of prime factors in other factorials?\n7. What is the significance of knowing the number of prime factors in a factorial?"
