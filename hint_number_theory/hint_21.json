    "problem": "What is the remainder when 5462 is divided by 9?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "A number is congruent to the sum of its own digits modulo 9.  (In other words, if you have a number $n$, and the sum of its digits is $m$, then $n$ and $m$ leave the same remainder when divided by 9.)\n\nThe sum of the digits of 5462 is $5 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 17$, and the sum of the digits of 17 is $1 + 7 = 8$.  Therefore, the remainder when 5462 is divided by 9 is $\\boxed{8}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for a number to be congruent to the sum of its own digits modulo 9?\n2. How can we find the sum of the digits of the number 5462?\n3. What is the sum of the digits of 5462?\n4. How does the sum of the digits of 5462 help us find the remainder when it is divided by 9?\n5. Can you explain why the remainder when dividing the sum of the digits of 5462 by 9 is the same as the remainder when dividing 5462 by 9?\n6.
