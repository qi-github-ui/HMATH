    "problem": "There is only one set of five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6.  What is the sum of those five prime numbers?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since $6=2\\times3$, the members of the arithmetic sequences with a common difference of 6 that start with 2 or 3 are multiples of 2 or 3 and hence not prime. Therefore, let's start with the next prime, 5, and form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6: 5, 11, 17, 23, 29. All five members of the sequence are prime, so we can now compute the sum. The sum of those five prime numbers is $5+11+17+23+29=\\boxed{85}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How do we know that there is only one set of five prime numbers that form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6?\n2. Why is it important to find prime numbers specifically? Are there any properties or characteristics of prime numbers that could help us in this problem?\n3. What is the significance of the common difference being 6? Are there any patterns or relationships between prime numbers that could be relevant here?\n4. How can we determine the starting point of the arithmetic sequence? Are there any restrictions or considerations for the starting number in order for all five numbers to be prime?\n5. How can we generate an arithmetic sequence that meets the given criteria? Can you come up with a systematic approach to finding the prime numbers in the sequence?\n6. How can we verify that the generated sequence indeed consists of five prime numbers? Is there a way to check the primality of each number efficiently?\n7. What is the sum of the five prime numbers in the arithmetic sequence? Can you explain the reasoning behind computing the sum in this specific way?"
