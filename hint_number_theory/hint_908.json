    "solution": "First, since $(2,11)=1$, a number is divisible by $22=2\\cdot11$ if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 11. $5d5,22e$ is divisible by 2 if and only if $e$ is even ($e$=0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). Also, $5d5,\\!22e$ is divisible by 11 if and only if $(5+5+2)-(d+2+e)=10-(d+e)$ is divisible by 11. Thus, $d+e=10$. We are looking to maximize $d$, so we need to minimize $e$. $e\\ne0$ (otherwise $d=10$, which is not a digit). Thus we take $e=2$, so the maximum value of $d$ is $d=10-2=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What can you tell us about the number 22? How can we determine if a number is divisible by 22?\n2. What are the possible values for the digit \"e\"? Why can e not be zero?\n3. How can we determine if a number is divisible by 2? Why does e need to be even?\n4. Can you explain why a 6-digit number of the form $5d5,22e$ should be divisible by 11?\n5. What is the relationship between the sum of the digits in $5d5,22e$ and whether it is divisible by 11? How does this lead to $d + e = 10$?\n6. To maximize the value of d, what value should e be? Why?"
