    "problem": "Natasha has more than $\\$1$ but less than $\\$10$ worth of dimes. When she puts her dimes in stacks of 3, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 4, she has 1 left over. When she puts them in stacks of 5, she also has 1 left over. How many dimes does Natasha have?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of dimes Natasha has.  We know that $10<n<100$.  The stacking data can be rephrased as  \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod3\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod4\\\\\nn&\\equiv 1\\pmod5.\\\\\n\\end{align*} Notice that any number $n$ such that $n\\equiv 1\\pmod{60}$ solves this system.  (The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that 1 is the only residue class modulo 60 that solves all of these equivalences.)  Therefore $n=\\boxed{61}$ is between 10 and 100 and solves this system.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the range of possible values for the number of dimes Natasha has?\n2. How can we rephrase the stacking data using modular arithmetic?\n3. According to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, what condition must be satisfied for a number to be a solution to the system of equivalences?\n4. How can we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find a solution for the system of equivalences?\n5. Based on the system of equivalences, what is the smallest possible value for the number of dimes Natasha has?\n6. How do we know that there are no other numbers within the given range that satisfy the system of equivalences?\n7. Can you think of any other situations or problems where we can apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem?"
