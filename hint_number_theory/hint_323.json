    "solution": "To find the sum, we compute the first few cubes modulo 6: \\begin{align*}\n1^3 &\\equiv 1, \\\\\n2^3 &\\equiv 8 \\equiv 2, \\\\\n3^3 &\\equiv 27 \\equiv 3, \\\\\n4^3 &\\equiv 64 \\equiv 4, \\\\\n5^3 &\\equiv 125 \\equiv 5, \\\\\n6^3 &\\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}.\n\\end{align*}We see that $n^3 \\equiv n \\pmod{6}$ for all integers $n$, so \\begin{align*}\n1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \\dots + 100^3 &\\equiv 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 100 \\\\\n&\\equiv \\frac{100 \\cdot 101}{2} \\\\\n&\\equiv 5050 \\\\\n&\\equiv \\boxed{4} \\pmod{6}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe how to find the sum of the cubes from $1^3$ to $n^3$, where $n$ is any positive integer?\n2. What is the pattern you observe when finding the remainders of the first few cubes when divided by 6?\n3. How can we use this pattern to simplify the expression $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \\dots + 100^3$?\n4. How can we express each individual cube $n^3$ in terms of its remainder when divided by 6?\n5. Based on the pattern we observed, can you simplify the expression $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \\dots + 100^3$ further?\n6. What is the sum of the sequence $1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 100$?\n7. Can you find the remainder when $5050$ is divided by $6$?\n8. How does the remainder of the simplified expression relate to the original expression $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \\dots + 100^3$?"
