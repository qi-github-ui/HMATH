How can we simplify the congruence equation using the properties of modular arithmetic?\n3. What does it mean for a number to be congruent to the inverse of another number modulo 9?\n4. How can we rewrite $(3^{2n}+4)^{-1}$ in terms of $9^n$?\n5. How can we further simplify $(9^n+4)^{-1}$ using the properties of modular arithmetic?\n6. How can we find the inverse of 4 modulo 9?\n7. How can we verify that the obtained value for $a$ is indeed the remainder when $a$ is divided by 9?\n8. Can you think of any other types of congruence equations where similar reasoning and steps might be applicable?"
