    "solution": "We start working from the rightmost column. Since $5>2$, $A_6+B_6+5_6$ is either equal to $12_6$ or $22_6$. Therefore, $A_6+B_6$ is either equal to $3_6$ or $13_6$.\n\nWe then look at the second rightmost digits. If $A_6+B_6=13_6$, then $2_6+B_6+1_6+1_6=5_6$. This means that $B_6=1$, which makes $A_6=12_6$. Since $A$ has to be a single-digit integer, this is impossible. Therefore, we try $A_6+B_6=3_6$. This gives us $1_6+B_6+1_6+1_6=5_6$, which means $B_6=2$, and $A_6=1_6$. We plug $B=2$ and $A=1$ into the equation to see if it works.  $$ \\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & &_{1}&\\\\ & & & 2& 2 & 1_6\\\\ & & & 4 & 1 & 2_6\\\\& & + & 1 & 1 & 5_6\\\\ \\cline{2-6} & & 1 & 1 & 5& 2_6\\\\ \\end{array} $$Therefore, the difference is $2_6 - 1_6 = \\boxed{1_6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step taken when solving the problem?\n2. In which column did you begin your calculations? Is there a specific reason you chose to start there?\n3. If $A_6+B_6+5_6$ had equaled $22_6$ instead of $12_6$, what would that have meant for the values of $A_6$ and $B_6$?\n4. Why is it impossible for $A_6+B_6$ to equal $13_6$? Can this be generalized to other base systems?\n5. What is the significance of the fact that $B_6$ equals $2_6$ in the solution? Could there have been other values that worked?\n6. Are there any other methods you could have used to solve the problem? How do you know that this method is the most efficient?"
