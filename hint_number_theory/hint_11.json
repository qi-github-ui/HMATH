    "problem": "What is the largest number, all of whose digits are 3 or 2, and whose digits add up to $11$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "To make a number as large as possible, we want as many digits as possible, so we want the digits to be as small as possible. To have the most number of digits, we use 4 twos and 1 three to make $4 \\cdot 2 +3 =11$. We want to arrange them in decreasing order because we want the digits to the left to be as large as possible. Therefore, we have the number $\\boxed{32222}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the objective of finding the largest number in this problem?\n2. How can we determine the maximum number of digits in the desired number?\n3. What digits can we use in this number to ensure their sum is 11?\n4. How can we arrange the digits to maximize the value of the number?\n5. Why do we arrange the digits in decreasing order?\n6. Can you provide the final number that satisfies all the given conditions?"
