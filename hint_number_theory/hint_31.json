    "problem": "A school has between 150 and 200 students enrolled. Every afternoon, all the students come together to participate in gym class. The students are separated into six distinct sections of students. If one student is absent from school, the sections can all have the same number of students. What is the sum of all possible numbers of students enrolled at the school?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If there are $s$ students, then $s-1$ must be divisible by 6. In other words, we want to find the sum of all values of $s$ for which $s-1\\equiv 0\\pmod{6}$. The multiples of 6 in the given range are 150, 156, ..., 198, so the possible values of $s$ are 151, 157, ..., 199. Recalling that the sum of an arithmetic series is  \\[\n\\frac{(\\text{first term}+\\text{last term})(\\text{number of terms})}{2},\n\\]we find that these integers sum to $(151+199)(9)/2=\\boxed{1575}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the problem and what we're trying to find in your own words?\n2. How does the fact that the sections must have the same number of students if one student is absent help us narrow down the possible values for the number of students enrolled?\n3. What does it mean for a number to be divisible by 6? How can we use this to find the possible values for the number of students?\n4. Can you explain how we determine the possible values for the number of students enrolled using modular arithmetic?\n5. Can you describe the arithmetic series that represents the possible values for the number of students? How can we find the sum of this series?\n6. Can you calculate the sum of all possible numbers of students enrolled at the school based on our findings?"
