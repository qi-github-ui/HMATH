    "problem": "What is the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Start with small exponents and look for a pattern.  We have $5^1\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$ and $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We can multiply both sides of $5^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$ by 5 to find that $5^3\\equiv 5\\pmod{8}$.  Multiplying both sides by 5 again, we find $5^4\\equiv 1\\pmod{8}$.  We see that every odd power of 5 is congruent to 5 modulo 8, and every even power is congruent to 1 modulo 8.  Therefore, $5^{137}$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{5}$ when divided by 8.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you begin solving this problem? Can you describe the first step?\n2. Are there any patterns you can observe when calculating small powers of 5 modulo 8?\n3. Based on the patterns you noticed, can you make any predictions about the remainder when larger powers of 5 are divided by 8?\n4. Why do the odd powers of 5 seem to have a consistent remainder when divided by 8? What about the even powers?\n5. How can you apply the patterns you've observed to determine the remainder when $5^{137}$ is divided by 8?\n6. Can you think of any other similar problems or situations where modular arithmetic and patterns can help you find remainders?"
