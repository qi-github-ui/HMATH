    "problem": "What is the $111$th digit after the decimal point when $\\frac{33}{555}$ is expressed as a decimal?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Using long division, we find that $\\frac{33}{555}$ can be expressed as a repeating decimal $0.0\\overline{594}$.\n\nAfter the first digit, there is a three-digit repeating block. We want to find the $110$th digit after the first digit. The remainder when $110$ is divided by $3$ is $2$. Therefore, the $111$th digit is the second digit in the repeating block, which is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we express $\\frac{33}{555}$ as a decimal?\n2. Can you describe the process of long division and how it can be used to find the decimal representation of a fraction?\n3. What do you notice about the decimal representation of $\\frac{33}{555}$ after the decimal point? Is there a pattern?\n4. How can we determine the number of digits in the repeating block?\n5. Why does the repeating block have three digits in this case?\n6. What can we deduce about the position of a specific digit within the repeating block?\n7. How can we use the remainder when dividing the desired position by the length of the repeating block to find the corresponding digit?\n8. Can you generalize this method to find the nth digit after the decimal point in any repeating decimal representation?"
