    "problem": "What is the largest integer that is a divisor of \\[\n(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)\n\\]for all positive even integers $n$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Among five consecutive odd numbers, at least one is divisible by 3 and exactly one is divisible by 5, so the product is always divisible by 15. The cases $n=2$, $n=10$, and $n=12$ demonstrate that no larger common divisor is possible, since $\\boxed{15}$ is the greatest common divisor of $3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot9\\cdot11$, $11\\cdot13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19$, and $13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19\\cdot21$.",

How can we determine the largest integer that is a divisor of the expression?\n4. What are the prime factors of the given expression?\n5. Can you determine the highest power of each prime factor that divides the expression?\n6. How does the fact that $n$ is a positive even integer affect the expression?\n7. How does the presence of consecutive odd numbers impact the expression?\n8. How does the statement \"at least one is divisible by 3 and exactly one is divisible by 5\" help us find the largest divisor?\n9. Can you provide examples of numbers that would result in a different largest divisor?\n10. Is there a general strategy or approach we can use to find the largest divisor in similar problems?"
