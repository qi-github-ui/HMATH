    "problem": "How many positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Every even multiple of 5 has a units digit of 0 and every odd multiple of 5 has a units digit of 5. There are $100/5=20$ positive multiples of 5 less than or equal to 100. One half of them, $20/2=10$, are odd multiples of 5. Therefore, $\\boxed{10}$ positive multiples of 5 that are less than 100 have a units digit of 5.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define a positive multiple of 5? \n2. What is the range of possible units digits for any multiple of 5? \n3. In this problem, what is the condition that a positive multiple of 5 must satisfy in order to have a units digit of 5? \n4. How many positive multiples of 5 are there less than or equal to 100? \n5. What fraction of these multiples are odd? \n6. How can we use this information to determine the number of positive multiples of 5 less than 100 that have a units digit of 5? \n7. Can you think of any other situations where we might need to consider the units digit of a number?"
