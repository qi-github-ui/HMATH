    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "First, we simplify $1356 \\pmod{22}$ to $1356 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$. Therefore, we have $$3n \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22}$$This means that $3n$ can be written in the form $22a+14$, where $a$ is an integer. So we have $3n=22a+14$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest $a$ such that $\\frac{22a+14}{3}=n$ is an integer, which we can easily find to be $1$. Therefore, $n=\\frac{22+14}{3}=\\boxed{12}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given congruence equation and the modulo used?\n2. How can we simplify the congruence equation by reducing the modulo?\n3. What does it mean for $3n$ to be congruent to $14$ modulo $22$?\n4. How can we rewrite the congruence equation in the form $3n = 22a + 14$?\n5. What is the key objective in finding the smallest positive integer $n$?\n6. How can we determine the value of $a$ that makes $\\frac{22a+14}{3}$ an integer?\n7. What is the value of $n$ when we substitute the smallest value of $a$ into the equation?\n8. How does this value of $n$ satisfy the original congruence equation?"
