    "solution": "We may carry out long division in base 4 just as in base 10. We have  \\[\n\\begin{array}{cc|cccc}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & & 3 & 3 \\\\\n\\cline{3-6}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} && 3&3& \\downarrow \\\\ \\cline{4-5}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} && 0&3&3 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} && & 3&3 \\\\ \\cline{5-6}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} && & & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]for a quotient of $\\boxed{33_4}$. Note that in the above calculation we have used that $11_4\\cdot3_4=5_{10}\\cdot3_{10}=15_{10}=33_4$. Then, for the second step we used $33_4$ divided by $11_4$ is $3_4$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the process of long division in base 4?\n2. How do we represent the numbers 1023 and 11 in base 4 before carrying out the division operation?\n3. How did we determine that $11_4 \\cdot 3_4 = 33_4$?\n4. Why did we use $33_4$ as the first digit of the quotient?\n5. How did we calculate the remainder in each step of the long division process?\n6. How can we verify that our final quotient of $33_4$ is correct?"
