    "problem": "What is the product of the digits in the base 8 representation of $6543_{10}$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "To convert to base 8, we realize $8^{5}>6543_{10}>8^{4}$. So, we can tell that $6543_{10}$ in base eight will have five digits. $8^{4}=4096$, which can go into 6543 only one time at most, leaving $6543-1\\cdot4096 = 2447$ for the next four digits. $8^{3}=512$ goes into 2447 four times at most, leaving us with $2447-4\\cdot512 = 399$. Then, $8^{2}=64$ goes into 399 six times at most, leaving $399-6\\cdot64 = 15$. Next, we have $8^{1}=8$, which can go into 15 one time, leaving $15-1\\cdot8 = 7$ for the ones digit. All together, the base eight equivalent of $6543_{10}$ is $14617_{8}$.  We are looking for the product of the digits, which is $1\\cdot4\\cdot6\\cdot1\\cdot7 = \\boxed{168}$.",

How do we determine the number of digits in the base 8 representation of a given number?\n4. Can you explain why $8^4$ is the largest power we need to consider in this case?\n5. Why do we subtract the largest multiple of $8^4$ from the given number?\n6. How do we continue the process for the remaining digits?\n7. Why do we repeat this process with smaller powers of 8?\n8. How do we calculate the product of the digits in a given base 8 number?\n9. Can you think of an alternative approach to finding the base 8 representation of a given number?\n10. How could we generalize this process to convert numbers to different bases?"
