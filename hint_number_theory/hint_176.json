    "problem": "How many integers between $500$ and $1000$ contain both the digits $3$ and $4$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "First we notice that the hundreds digit of any integer between $500$ and $1000$ cannot be $3$ or $4$, so $3$ and $4$ must be the units and tens digits (in either the order $34$ or $43$). Since the integer must be between $500$ and $1000$, there are $5$ choices for the hundreds digit of this integer ($5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, or $9$). Thus, there are $2 \\times 5 = \\boxed{10}$ ways to form such a number.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the range of integers we are considering in this problem?\n2. What are the possible digits for the units and tens places of the integer?\n3. Are there any restrictions on the hundreds digit of the integer? If so, what are they?\n4. How many choices do we have for the hundreds digit?\n5. How many ways can we arrange the digits 3 and 4 in the units and tens places?\n6. What is the total number of integers that satisfy the given conditions?"
