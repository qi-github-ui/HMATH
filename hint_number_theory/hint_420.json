    "problem": "In a certain warehouse, there are $1335$ boxes, each containing $39$ books.\n\nMelvin's boss orders him to unpack all the books and repack them so that there are $40$ books in each box. After packing as many such boxes as possible, Melvin has how many books left over?",

    "solution": "The total number of books in the warehouse is $1335\\cdot 39$. If Melvin packs $b$ boxes of $40$ books each and has $r$ books left over, then $1335\\cdot 39 = 40b+r$. Thus, what we are looking for is the remainder when $1335\\cdot 39$ is divided by $40$.\n\nWe note that $39\\equiv -1\\pmod{40}$. Therefore, we have \\begin{align*}\n1335\\cdot 39 &\\equiv 1335\\cdot (-1) \\\\\n&\\equiv -1335\\pmod {40}.\n\\end{align*}Now we note that $-1335 = -1400 + 65$, and $-1400$ is a multiple of $40$. Therefore, $-1335 \\equiv 65 \\equiv 25\\pmod{40}$, which implies that the remainder is $\\boxed{25}$ books.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of books in the warehouse? Can you calculate it?\n2. How many boxes does Melvin need to pack in order to have exactly 40 books in each box?\n3. If Melvin packs that many boxes, what will be the total number of books packed? Can you calculate it?\n4. How many books are left over after packing those boxes? How can we find the remainder?\n5. Can you express the total number of books in terms of 40 and the remainder?\n6. Can you apply the modulo operation to find the remainder when 1335 multiplied by 39 is divided by 40?\n7. Can you simplify the expression using modular arithmetic? What is the remainder?"
