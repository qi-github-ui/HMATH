    "problem": "What is the sum of the digits of the base-2 expression for $222_{10}$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We see that $2^7=128$ is the largest power of 2 less than 222, leaving us with $222-128=94$. Since the next largest power of 2, $2^6=64$, is less than 94, we are left with the remainder $94-64=30$. Because $2^5=32$ is greater than 30, the next non-zero coefficient goes to the $2^4=16$ term, giving us a remainder of $30-16=14$. Continuing from here, we find that $222_{10}=1\\cdot2^7+1\\cdot2^6+0\\cdot2^5+1\\cdot2^4+1\\cdot2^3+1\\cdot2^2+1\\cdot2^1+0\\cdot2^0=11011110_2$. This gives us the sum $1+1+0+1+1+1+1+0=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we express the decimal number 222 in base-2 (binary) form?\n2. What is the largest power of 2 that is less than 222? What is the corresponding binary digit for this power of 2?\n3. What is the remainder when we subtract the largest power of 2 from 222?\n4. Is the next largest power of 2 less than the remainder we obtained in the previous step? If not, what is the new remainder after subtracting the next largest power of 2?\n5. How can we express the decimal number 222 in terms of the binary digits obtained so far?\n6. Can we continue this process of finding the binary digits for the remaining powers of 2 until we reach the smallest power of 2?\n7. What is the binary expression for $222_{10}$ when we have obtained all the binary digits?\n8. What is the sum of the digits in the base-2 expression for 222?"
