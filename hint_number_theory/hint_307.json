    "problem": "It is now 12:00:00 midnight, as read on a 12-hour digital clock. In 122 hours, 39 minutes and 44 seconds the time will be $A:B:C$. What is the value of $A + B + C$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since the clock reads the same time every 12 hours, we find the remainder after dividing 122 hours by 12 hours, which is 2 hours. Counting forward from midnight, the clock will read 2:39:44, so $A+B+C = \\boxed{85}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What type of clock is being used in this problem, and how does it differ from a 24-hour clock?\n2. How many hours are in one revolution of the 12-hour clock?\n3. How can we find the remainder after dividing 122 hours by 12 hours?\n4. From what time should we begin counting forward to find the time in 122 hours, 39 minutes and 44 seconds?\n5. How can we convert the remaining minutes and seconds into hours?\n6. What is the significance of adding together the digits of the clock time in this problem?\n7. How can we check our answer to make sure that the sum of $A+B+C$ is correct?"
