    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "First we note that $11=11^1<115<11^2=121$. Therefore, we know that $115_{10}$ will be a two digit number in base 11. The digit in the $11^1$ place will be $\\text{A}$ because $10\\cdot 11^1$ is the largest multiple of $11$ that is less than or equal to $115$, and in base 11, $\\text{A}$ is used to represent $10$. The digit in the $11^0$ place will be $5$ because $115-110=5$. The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{A5}_{11}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we determine the number of digits in the base 11 representation of $115_{10}$?\n2. Can you explain why $10$ is represented as $\\text{A}$ in base 11?\n3. What is the largest power of $11$ that is less than or equal to $115_{10}$?\n4. How do we determine the digit in the $11^1$ place in the base 11 representation?\n5. What is the digit in the $11^0$ place and how do we calculate it?\n6. Can you explain why the final answer is $\\text{A5}_{11}$?\n7. Can you think of another number that could be converted to base 11 using similar steps?"
