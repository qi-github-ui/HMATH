    "solution": "Let $a$ be the inverse of $201$ modulo $299$. Then, by the definition of the inverse, $201\\cdot a \\equiv 1\\pmod{299}$. We are looking for an integer $a$ that satisfies this congruence.\n\nTo make our task easier, we note that $603\\equiv 5\\pmod{299}$, and so \\begin{align*}\n603\\cdot 60 &\\equiv 5\\cdot 60 \\\\\n&= 300 \\\\\n&\\equiv 1\\pmod{299}.\n\\end{align*}Now we write $603$ as $201\\cdot 3$: $$201\\cdot 3\\cdot 60 \\equiv 1\\pmod{299}.$$Thus, the inverse we seek is $a = 3\\cdot 60 = \\boxed{180}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we find the multiplicative inverse of a number modulo another number?\n2. What is the definition of the multiplicative inverse modulo a number?\n3. Can we use any number as the multiplicative inverse modulo another number, or are there certain conditions that need to be satisfied?\n4. How can we simplify the given congruence to make it easier to find the inverse?\n5. Why did we choose to write $603$ as $201 \\cdot 3$ in the congruence?\n6. What steps did we take to find the value of $a$?\n7. Can you think of any other numbers or congruences where we can apply similar steps to find the multiplicative inverse modulo a given number?\n8. How can we verify that our answer is correct?"
