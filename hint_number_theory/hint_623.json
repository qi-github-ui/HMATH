    "problem": "The sum of all the positive factors of integer $x$ is 24. If one of the factors is 3, what is the value of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "From the given information, the positive factors of $x$ include $1, 3,\\frac{x}{3}$, and $x$. Therefore, we must have $1+3+\\frac{x}{3}+x\\le24$. Simplifying, we find $x\\le15$. Testing $x=15$, we succeed: $1+3+5+15=24$. We try 3, 6, 9, and 12 to confirm that only 15 yields a sum of 24. Thus, $x=\\boxed{15}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of \"positive factors\" of an integer?\n2. How can we find all the positive factors of an integer?\n3. Can you list all the positive factors of 15?\n4. What is the sum of all the positive factors of 15?\n5. How did we use the fact that one of the factors of $x$ is 3 to solve the problem?\n6. Can you think of another way to approach this problem?"
