    "problem": "Cameron writes down the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, and all the multiples of 20 between them.  How many integers are in Cameron's list?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "A perfect square that is a multiple of $20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^1$ must be a multiple of $2^2 \\cdot 5^2 = 100$.  A perfect cube that is a multiple of 20 must be a multiple of $2^3 \\cdot 5^3 = 1000$.  Our goal is thus to count the multiples of 20 from 100 to 1000 inclusive: $$ 100 \\le 20n \\le 1000. $$Dividing this entire inequality by 20 we get $5 \\le n \\le 50$, so there are $50 - 5 + 1 = \\boxed{46}$ integers in Cameron's list.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain why we are looking for perfect squares and cubes that are multiples of 20 in this problem?\n2. What is the smallest perfect square that is a multiple of 20? How did you arrive at this answer?\n3. How about the smallest perfect cube that is a multiple of 20? How did you arrive at this answer?\n4. What is the relationship between a number that is a perfect square or cube and its prime factorization?\n5. By using the prime factorization of 20, we concluded that any perfect square or cube that is a multiple of 20 must be a multiple of a certain number. What is this number? How did we obtain it?\n6. How did we use this number to determine the numbers that we need to count in Cameron's list?\n7. Can you explain how we arrived at the inequality $100 \\le 20n \\le 1000$? \n8. What is the range of possible values for $n$ based on this inequality?\n9. How did we use this range to determine the number of integers in Cameron's list? \n10. Can you think of other similar problems that involve finding certain kinds of numbers in a given range? What strategies might be useful in those problems?"
