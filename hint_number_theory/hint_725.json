    "problem": "Josef and Timothy play a game in which Josef picks an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive and Timothy divides 1000 by that integer and states whether or not the quotient is an integer.  How many integers could Josef pick such that Timothy's quotient is an integer?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Timothy's quotient is an integer if and only if Josef's number is a divisor of 1000.  Our goal is to count the positive divisors of $1000 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3$. We see that 1000 has $(3 + 1)(3+1) = 16$ positive divisors, hence there are $\\boxed{16}$ integers Josef could pick to make Timothy's number an integer.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain how Timothy's quotient is an integer if and only if Josef's number is a divisor of 1000?\n2. How can we determine the number of positive divisors of 1000? Can you explain the reasoning behind it?\n3. What are the prime factorizations of 2 and 5? How can we use them to find the prime factorization of 1000?\n4. How can we calculate the number of divisors using the prime factorization of 1000?\n5. Can you explain why the formula for calculating the number of divisors is $(3+1)(3+1)$ in this case?\n6. Are there any factors of 1000 that we missed in our count? Is there a systematic way to make sure we haven't missed any factors?\n7. Can you provide an example of a positive divisor of 1000 and explain why it satisfies the condition for Timothy's quotient to be an integer?\n8. Can you think of other numbers where we can apply a similar approach to count the positive divisors?"
