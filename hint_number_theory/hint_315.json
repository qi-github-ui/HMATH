    "problem": "What is the sum of all of the odd divisors of $180$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "First, we find the prime factorization of $180$ to be $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$. Note that the odd divisors of 180 are precisely the integers of the form $3^a5^b$ where $0\\leq a \\leq 2$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 1$. Note also that distributing $(1+3+9)(1+5)$ yields 6 terms, with each integer of the form $3^a5^b$ appearing exactly once.  It follows that the sum of the odd divisors of 180 is $(1+3+9)(1+5)=13 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{78}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the prime factorization of 180?\n2. Why do we only consider the odd divisors of 180 in this problem?\n3. How many odd divisors does 180 have?\n4. What is the general form of an odd divisor of 180?\n5. How can we express the sum of the odd divisors in terms of the powers of 3 and 5?\n6. How did we come up with the expression $(1+3+9)(1+5)$?\n7. Can we use a different method to find the sum of the odd divisors of 180? If so, how?"
