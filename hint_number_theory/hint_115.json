    "problem": "What is the remainder when (99)(101) is divided by 9?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Notice that when we divide (99)(101) by 9, we get $\\frac{99\\cdot101}{9}=11\\cdot101$. The quotient is an integer and there is no remainder, so (99)(101) is a multiple of 9 and the remainder is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nOR\n\nWe notice that $99\\cdot101=99\\cdot100+99=9999$. We can easily see that 9999 is divisible by 9, as the division results in 1111 with a remainder of 0. Alternatively, a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. In this case, the sum of the digits in 36, a multiple of 9, so 9999 is a also a multiple of 9. That means the remainder when it is divided by 9 is $\\boxed{0}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the process of dividing (99)(101) by 9?\n2. Can you explain why we can rewrite (99)(101) as 11*101?\n3. How do we know that 11*101 is divisible by 9 and has no remainder?\n4. Is there another way to determine if a number is divisible by 9? If so, how?\n5. What is the sum of the digits in 9999, and how does that relate to divisibility by 9?\n6. Can you think of other numbers or expressions that can be approached in a similar way to find the remainder when divided by 9?"
