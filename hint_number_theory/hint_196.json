    "problem": "What is the greatest common divisor of $1729$ and $1768$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 1768 - 1729) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(1729, 39).\n\\end{align*}Since the sum of the digits of $1729$ is $19$, which is not divisible by $3$, it suffices to check whether or not $1729$ is divisible by $13$. We can find that it is by long division or noting that $12+1 = \\boxed{13}$ divides into $1729 = 12^3 + 1^3$ using the sum of cubes factorization.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the greatest common divisor (gcd) means and why it's important in number theory?\n2. How does the Euclidean algorithm work and what is its significance in computing the gcd of two numbers?\n3. Why do we subtract the smaller number from the larger number in each step of the Euclidean algorithm?\n4. What would happen if we reversed the order of the two numbers in the gcd computation using the Euclidean algorithm?\n5. How can we determine if a number is divisible by another number without using long division?\n6. Why does checking whether a number is divisible by $13$ using the sum of cubes factorization work? \n7. Can you provide an example of computing the gcd of two larger numbers using the Euclidean algorithm?"
