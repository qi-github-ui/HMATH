    "problem": "Suppose that  $a$ and $b$ are digits, not both nine and not both zero, and the repeating decimal  $0.\\overline{ab}$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms. How many different denominators are possible?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since $0.\\overline{ab} = \\frac{ab}{99}$, the denominator must be a factor of $99 = 3^2 \\cdot 11$. The factors of $99$ are $1,$ $3,$ $9,$ $11,$ $33,$ and  $99$. Since $a$ and $b$ are not both nine,  the denominator cannot be $1$. By choosing $a$ and $b$ appropriately,  we can make fractions with each of the other denominators.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe how the decimal $0.\\overline{ab}$ can be expressed as a fraction? What does the numerator and denominator represent in this fraction?\n2. What conditions must the digits $a$ and $b$ satisfy in order to express $0.\\overline{ab}$ as a fraction in lowest terms?\n3. What is the prime factorization of $99$, and why is it relevant to this problem?\n4. How many factors does $99$ have, and why is the number of factors important in determining the number of possible denominators?\n5. If $a$ and $b$ cannot both be $9$ or $0$, what are the possible digit combinations for $a$ and $b$? How many different combinations are there?\n6. For each possible combination of $a$ and $b$, what is the corresponding denominator of the fraction? Can you explain why each denominator is valid?\n7. Are there any denominators that are not possible? Why or why not?\n8. Can you think of any other similar fractions or situations where the same kind of thinking and steps would be applicable?"
