    "solution": "First, we convert $0.\\overline{81}$ to a fraction by the following trick. Let $x=0.\\overline{81}$. Then $100x=81.\\overline{81}$, so we can subtract:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&100x &=& 81&.818181\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.818181\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&99x &=& 81 &\n\\end{array}$$\n\nTherefore, $x=\\frac{81}{99}=\\frac{9}{11}$.\n\nAt this point, we could write $0.81$ as $\\frac{81}{100}$ and subtract this from $\\frac{9}{11}$. However, the following observation will save us some work: \\begin{align*}\n0.\\overline{81} - 0.81 &= 0.818181\\ldots - 0.81 \\\\\n&= 0.008181\\ldots \\\\\n&= \\frac{x}{100}.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, $$0.\\overline{81} - 0.81 = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{1100}}.$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain how we can convert the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{81}$ into a fraction using the trick mentioned?\n2. Why do we set $x=0.\\overline{81}$ and multiply it by 100 in the subtraction step? What purpose does it serve?\n3. How do we subtract $x=0.\\overline{81}$ from $100x=81.\\overline{81}$ in the given context? What is the significance of this subtraction?\n4. What does it mean when we say that $0.\\overline{81}$ exceeds $0.81$ by a certain common fraction? Can you provide a general definition for this concept?\n5. How can we simplify the fraction $\\frac{81}{99}$? Are there any common factors we can cancel out?\n6. Can you explain the additional observation made in the solution regarding the subtraction of $0.81$ from $0.\\overline{81}$? How does it help us simplify the calculation?\n7. Could there be alternative methods to convert $0.\\overline{81}$ into a fraction? What factors would you consider in choosing which method to use?"
