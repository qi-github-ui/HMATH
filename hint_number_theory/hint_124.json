    "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $3n$ is a perfect square and $2n$ is a perfect cube?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since $3n$ is a perfect square, that means that $n$ has to be a multiple of $3$. Since $2n$ is a perfect cube, then $n$ has to be divisible by $2^2=4$. Since $n$ is a multiple of $3$, then $n$ also has to be divisible by $3^3=27$. Therefore, the smallest value for $n$ is $4 \\cdot 27 =\\boxed{108}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean for $3n$ to be a perfect square?\n2. What condition does $n$ need to satisfy for $2n$ to be a perfect cube?\n3. How can the fact that $3n$ is a perfect square be used to determine the divisibility of $n$ by which number(s)?\n4. How can the fact that $2n$ is a perfect cube be used to determine the divisibility of $n$ by which number(s)?\n5. What is the smallest positive integer value for $n$ that satisfies both of these conditions?\n6. Can you explain why this value of $n$ is the smallest?"
