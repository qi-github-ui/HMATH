    "problem": "A pirate is counting the loot he has stolen from S.S. AOPS, on which everything is counted in base 5.  A treasure chest contains $3124_{5}$ dollars worth of jewelry, $3122_{5}$ dollars worth of gold coins, and $124_{5}$ dollars worth of rubbing alcohol.  What is the total dollar amount that this pirate has accumulated? Express your answer in base 10.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We would like to find $3124_{5}+3122_{5}+124_{5}$.\n\n$3124_{5} = 4\\cdot5^{0}+2\\cdot5^{1}+1\\cdot5^{2}+3\\cdot5^{3} = 4+10+25+375 = 414$\n\n$3122_{5} = 2\\cdot5^{0}+2\\cdot5^{1}+1\\cdot5^{2}+3\\cdot5^{3} = 2+10+25+375 = 412$\n\n$124_{5} = 4\\cdot5^{0}+2\\cdot5^{1}+1\\cdot5^{2} = 4+10+25 = 39$\n\nSumming all of these together yields $414+412+39= \\boxed{865}$ dollars.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step to find the total dollar amount in base 10 for the loot?\n2. In base 5, what are the place values for each digit?\n3. How can we convert each base 5 number to base 10?\n4. Why do we need to convert the base 5 numbers to base 10 in order to find the total dollar amount?\n5. Can you explain the process of converting $3124_{5}$ to base 10 using the given formula?\n6. Can you explain the process of converting $3122_{5}$ to base 10 using the given formula?\n7. Can you explain the process of converting $124_{5}$ to base 10 using the given formula?\n8. How do we calculate the sum of these converted numbers to find the total dollar amount?\n9. Is there any similarity between this problem and previous equations we discussed in Number Theory?\n10. Can you think of any other situations where converting numbers between different bases is useful?"
