    "problem": "Daniel has exactly $20$ pieces of candy. He has to divide them equally among his $3$ sisters. What is the least number of pieces he should take away so that he could distribute the candy equally?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "When you divide $20$ by $3$, you get $6$ with a remainder of $2$. Therefore, he should take away $\\boxed{2 \\text{ pieces}}$ so he could give each of his sisters $6$ pieces.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain in your own words what the problem is asking us to find?\n2. What do we know about the total number of candy pieces and the number of sisters?\n3. What does it mean to divide something equally among a group?\n4. What happens if we divide 20 by 3? Can you express the result both as a whole number quotient and as a remainder?\n5. How can we ensure that each sister receives an equal number of candy pieces?\n6. How many pieces does each sister get without taking away any candy pieces?\n7. Can we achieve an equal distribution of candy by simply dividing 20 by 3? Why or why not?\n8. If we take away some candy pieces, what should be the goal number of pieces left so that they can be divided equally among the sisters?\n9. How many pieces should Daniel take away to achieve this goal?\n10. Can you think of any other scenarios where a similar thought process and steps might be applied to achieve equal distribution among a group?"
