    "problem": "One digit of the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is randomly selected. What is the probability that the digit is a 4? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ is $0.\\overline{714285}$, which has a repeating block of 6 digits. Since 4 is one of those six digits that keep repeating, the probability that the selected digit is a 4 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define probability in this context?\n2. Can you explain what is meant by \"the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$\"?\n3. What does it mean for a digit to be \"randomly selected\" from a decimal representation?\n4. Based on the given information, what digits are possible to be selected? How many digits are there in total?\n5. How can we determine the probability of selecting a specific digit?\n6. Can you identify a pattern or rule in the decimal representation of $\\frac{5}{7}$ that can help us find the probability of selecting a particular digit?\n7. How does the length of the repeating block in the decimal representation affect the probability of selecting a specific digit?\n8. If the decimal representation had a different repeating block length, would the probability of selecting a specific digit change?\n9. How can we express the probability of selecting a 4 as a common fraction?"
