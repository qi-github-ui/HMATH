    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For $n$ to have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$, it is necessary for $n$ to be relatively prime to $1050$. Conversely, if $n$ is relatively prime to $1050$, then $n$ has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.\n\nThe prime factors of $1050$ include $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$, so any multiple of any of these primes does not have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$. This rules out all the integers from $2$ to $10$. However, $11$ is relatively prime to $1050$, so $\\boxed{11}$ is the smallest integer greater than $1$ that has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for an integer to have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$?\n2. According to the given information, what is the condition that an integer must satisfy in order to have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$?\n3. How can we determine whether an integer is relatively prime to $1050$?\n4. Can you provide a list of the integers from $2$ to $10$ that do not have an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$? Why don't they have an inverse?\n5. Which integer from $2$ to $10$ has the highest common factor with $1050$? Why does this factor prevent the integer from having an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$?\n6. What is the smallest integer greater than $1$ that is relatively prime to $1050$? How do you know it has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$?\n7. Are there any other ways to determine whether an integer has an inverse $\\pmod{1050}$ besides checking whether it is relatively prime to $1050$?\n8. Can you give an example of another number besides $1050$ where we need to check for relatively prime integers in order to determine if an inverse exists? What is the general rule for determining this?"
