    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since 3 and 4 are relatively prime, their least common multiple is $3\\cdot4=12$.  Therefore, the least common multiple of 30 and 40 is 120.  Since $\\boxed{120}$ is not divisible by 16, it is the smallest common multiple of 30 and 40 which is not divisible by 16.\n\nNote: Every common multiple of two integers is a multiple of their least common multiple.  Therefore, it is not possible that the least common multiple is divisible by 16 but some other common multiple is not.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the prime factors of 30, 40, and 16?\n2. What is the least common multiple (LCM) of 30 and 40, and how is it found?\n3. Is the LCM of 30 and 40 divisible by 16? Why or why not?\n4. What is the relationship between the LCM and the common multiples of two integers?\n5. Is there any smaller positive integer that is a multiple of both 30 and 40 but not divisible by 16? Why or why not?"
