    "problem": "When three positive integers are divided by $47$, the remainders are $25$, $20$, and $3$, respectively.\n\nWhen the sum of the three integers is divided by $47$, what is the remainder?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 25\\pmod{47}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 20\\pmod{47}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 3\\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 25+20+3 \\\\\n&= 48\\pmod{47}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $48$ upon division by $47$. This remainder is $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you restate the problem in your own words? What do we know and what do we need to find?\n2. How do we represent the three integers in this problem? What are their possible values?\n3. What do the remainders tell us about the three integers? Can we write these relationships as congruences?\n4. How can we use these congruences to find the sum of the three integers? What is the sum congruent to modulo 47?\n5. Can we use any other method to find the sum of the three integers? What would be the advantages or disadvantages of these methods?\n6. Are there any similar problems that we could solve using the same techniques? Can you think of an example?"
