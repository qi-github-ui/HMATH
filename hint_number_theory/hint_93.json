    "problem": "When the base-12 integer $1531_{12}$ is divided by $8$, what is the remainder?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We have $$1531_{12} = 12^3 + 5\\cdot 12^2 + 3\\cdot 12 + 1.$$Note that $12^2$ is divisible by $8$, so $$1531_{12} = (\\text{a multiple of 8}) + 3\\cdot 12 + 1.$$Therefore, the remainder upon dividing $1531_{12}$ by $8$ is the same as the remainder upon dividing $3\\cdot 12+1$ by $8$. This remainder is $\\boxed{5}$.",
