    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let us investigate the first few powers of 19: \\begin{align*}\n19^1 &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^2 &\\equiv 11 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^3 &\\equiv 9 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^4 &\\equiv 21 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^5 &\\equiv 24 \\pmod{25}.\n\\end{align*} At this point, we see that $19^5 \\equiv 24 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25},$ hence $19^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}.$ That means that $19^{1999} = 19^9 \\cdot (19^{10})^{199} \\equiv 19^9 \\pmod {25}.$\n\nSince $19^4 \\equiv 21 \\equiv -4 \\pmod{25}$ and $19^5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25},$ then $19^{1999} \\equiv 19^9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{25},$ hence our desired remainder is $\\boxed{4}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. Why did we investigate the first few powers of 19? Are there any patterns or observations that can be made?\n3. How do we determine when the powers of 19 start repeating? What does this tell us about finding the remainder?\n4. What did we notice about the power of 19 when it was congruent to 24 modulo 25? How did we use this to simplify our calculation?\n5. How did we rewrite $19^{1999}$ in terms of powers of 19 that are congruent to 1 modulo 25?\n6. What is the significance of $19^4 \\equiv 21 \\equiv -4 \\pmod{25}$ and $19^5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25}$? How did we use these congruences to find our final answer?\n7. Can you think of other similar problems where investigating powers of a number modulo another number can help determine remainders?"
