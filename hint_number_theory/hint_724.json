    "problem": "$A, B, C$ and $D$ are distinct positive integers such that the product $AB = 60$,  the product $CD = 60$ and $A - B = C + D$ .  What is the value of $A$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Produce an exhaustive list of the pairs of factors which multiply to give 60, as well as the sum and the difference of each pair of factors.  \\begin{tabular}{ccc}\nFactors & Sum & Difference \\\\ \\hline\n(1,60) & 61 & 59 \\\\\n(2,30) & 32 & 28 \\\\\n(3,20) & 23 & 17 \\\\\n(4,15) & 19 & 11 \\\\\n(5,12) & 17 & 7 \\\\\n(6,10) & 16 & 4\n\\end{tabular} The only number which appears in both the second column and the third column is 17.  Therefore, $(A,B)=(20,3)$ and $(C,D)=(5,12)\\text{ or }(12,5)$.  In particular, $A=\\boxed{20}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we represent the relationship between the values A, B, C, and D using equations?\n2. What do we know about the product AB and the product CD?\n3. How can we find the factors of 60? Can you list all the pairs that multiply to give 60?\n4. For each pair of factors, can you calculate the sum and difference? Can you record these values in a table?\n5. Looking at the table, do you notice any pattern or relationship between the sum and difference columns?\n6. Is there a pair of factors that have the same value for both sum and difference? If so, what is that value?\n7. Given that A - B = C + D, can we match the values in the sum and difference columns to find the values of A, B, C, and D?\n8. What are the possible pairs of (A, B) and (C, D) that satisfy the equation?\n9. Finally, what is the value of A that satisfies the given conditions?"
