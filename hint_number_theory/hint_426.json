    "problem": "When Carlos divides his marbles into groups of six, seven, or eight, he has one marble left over. Assuming Carlos has more than one marble, what is the smallest possible number of marbles in Carlos's collection?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $N$ be the number of marbles. We know that for some integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c,$ $$N = 6a+1,\\\\N = 7b+1, \\\\N = 8c +1.$$In other words, $N-1$ is divisible by $6,$ $7,$ and $8.$ We have $$\\text{lcm}[6,7,8] = \\text{lcm}[3,7,8]= 3\\cdot 7\\cdot 8 = 168,$$and so $168$ divides $N-1.$ The smallest possible value of $N$ greater than $1$ is $N = 168+1 = \\boxed{169}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we represent the problem mathematically using variables and equations?\n2. What does it mean for a number to have a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, 7, and 8?\n3. Can we find the smallest possible number that satisfies all three conditions simultaneously? If so, how?\n4. What are the common factors and multiples of 6, 7, and 8? How can we leverage this information to find the solution?\n5. Why is the least common multiple (LCM) of 6, 7, and 8 important in this problem?\n6. How can we use the LCM to determine the smallest possible number of marbles Carlos could have?\n7. Can you explain why the solution is 169 and how it satisfies all the given conditions?"
