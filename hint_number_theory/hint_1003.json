    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We have \\begin{align*}\n66666_{16} &= 6\\cdot 16^4 + 6\\cdot 16^3 + 6\\cdot 16^2 + 6\\cdot 16 + 6 \\\\\n&= 6\\cdot (16^4+16^3+16^2+16+1) \\\\\n&= 6\\cdot (2^{16}+2^{12}+2^8+2^4+1) \\\\\n&= (2^2+2)\\cdot (2^{16}+2^{12}+2^8+2^4+1) \\\\\n&= 2^{18}+2^{17}+2^{14}+2^{13}+2^{10}+2^9+2^6+2^5+2^2+2.\n\\end{align*}Actually, this is more detail than necessary; what is important is that $2^{18} \\le 66666_{16} < 2^{19}$, which tells us that the base-2 expression of this number has $\\boxed{19}$ digits or bits (with place values $2^{18},2^{17},2^{16},\\ldots,2^2,2^1,2^0$).",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what is meant by \"base-16 number\" and \"base-2 number\"?\n2. How can we convert a number from base-16 to base-2? Can you describe the general steps?\n3. What is the base-2 representation of the number 66666 in base-16?\n4. How can we determine the number of base-2 digits (bits) in a given base-2 number?\n5. Can you explain why we need to find the range of the base-2 representation of 66666 in order to determine the number of digits?\n6. How did you determine that $2^{18} \\leq 66666_{16} < 2^{19}$? What does this range tell us about the base-2 representation of 66666?\n7. How does the place value system work in base-2? Can you explain the significance of each digit's place value?\n8. Can you generalize this approach to determine the number of digits in the base-2 representation of any base-16 number?"
