    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "An integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{55}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,55)=1$. Similarly, an integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{66}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,66)=1$.\n\nSince we're looking for an integer that doesn't have an inverse modulo either $55$ or $66$, we want $a$ such that $\\gcd(a,55)>1$ and $\\gcd(a,66)>1$. Thus $a$ must be divisible by either $5$ or $11$, and $a$ must also be divisible by either $2$, $3$, or $11$. The smallest positive integer that satisfies both properties is $\\boxed{10}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for an integer $a$ to have an inverse modulo $n$?\n2. According to the given information, what must be true for $a$ to have an inverse modulo $55$ and modulo $66$?\n3. What property of $a$ allows it to not have an inverse modulo $55$? Why is this true?\n4. What property of $a$ allows it to not have an inverse modulo $66$? Why is this true?\n5. What is the smallest positive integer $a$ that satisfies both properties? How did you arrive at this answer?\n6. Can you verify that this integer does not have an inverse modulo $55$ or modulo $66$?"
