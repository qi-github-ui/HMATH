    "solution": "First, we need to find the largest possible value when sending a number with Option 2.  If we had 10 1s the smallest binary number would be: $$1111111111_2=1023$$ This is greater than 1000, so the greatest possible cost when sending with option 2 will be 9.  We can look at the largest numbers less than 1000 which cost 9 with Option 1 and see if they cost 9 with option 2.  The largest numbers are: $$900,810,801,720,711,702,...$$ The smallest possible number with 10 digits and cost 9 in Option 2 is: $$1011111111_2=767$$ Below this, we would have: $$111111111_2=511$$ which doesn't work.  We can quickly check the numbers above and see that they cost less than 9 with method 2.  So, we now need to consider numbers with cost of 8.  The largest numbers with a cost of 8 in Option 1 are: $$800,710,701,620,611,602,530,521,512,503,...$$ It is possible to check these in base 2 and see which is the first to cost 8 with Option 2, or we can go the other way and look at numbers with a cost of 8 in Option 2.  Either way, we will find the largest possible integer with a cost of 8 is: $$111110111_2 = 503$$ We must check and make sure that there are no numbers larger than $503$ with an Option 2 cost lower than 8. The numbers with cost 7 in Option 1 with value greater than $503$ are $700$, $610$, $601$, and $520$. We can check that all cost less than 7 in Option 2 and can be eliminated. The numbers with cost 6 in Option 1 with value greater than $503$ are $600$ and $510$, neither of which have cost 6 in Option 2 and therefore do not work. Since a number with cost 5 or lower must be less than 500, the largest possible integer is $\\boxed{503}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the two options provided by the Networked Number Node for transmitting a positive integer less than 1000?\n2. How does Option 1 determine the cost of transmitting a number?\n3. Can you explain how Option 2 works in encoding the integer into binary and determining the cost?\n4. What is the largest possible value when sending a number with Option 2?\n5. How can we find the largest integer less than 1000 that costs the same with both options?\n6. Can you list the largest numbers less than 1000 that have a cost of 9 with Option 1?\n7. Among the numbers with a cost of 9 in Option 1, can any of them also have a cost of 9 with Option 2?\n8. How can we determine the largest possible integer with a cost of 8 in Option 1?\n9. Can you verify if the largest numbers with a cost of 8 in Option 1 also have a cost of 8 in Option 2?\n10. With a cost of 8 in Option 2, what is the largest possible integer we can find?\n11. Do we need to consider numbers with a cost lower than 8 in Option 2? If so, why?\n12. How can we check if there are any larger numbers with an Option 2 cost lower than 8?\n13. Are there any numbers with a cost lower than 7 in Option 1 that have a higher value than the largest integer found so far?\n14. Can we eliminate any numbers with a cost of 6 in Option 1 that have a higher value than the largest integer found so far?\n15. What is the final conclusion in finding the largest integer that costs the same with both options?"
