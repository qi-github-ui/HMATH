    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We are looking for the smallest base $b$ such that $100_b \\le 62 < 1000_b$, which is the same as saying that $b^2 \\le 62 < b^3$.  The smallest perfect cube greater than 62 is 64, so the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\\sqrt[3]{64} = \\boxed{4}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find?\n2. How can we express 62 in base $b$ using only three digits?\n3. What is the range of values for $b$ that we need to consider?\n4. How can we rewrite the inequality $100_b \\le 62 < 1000_b$ in terms of $b$?\n5. How can we express $62$ in terms of $b$?\n6. What is the meaning of the expression $b^2 \\le 62 < b^3$?\n7. How can we determine the smallest perfect cube greater than 62?\n8. What is the formula to find the cube root of a number?\n9. Why is $\\sqrt[3]{64}$ the smallest possible value of $b$?\n10. How can we verify that 62 can indeed be expressed in base 4 using only three digits?"
