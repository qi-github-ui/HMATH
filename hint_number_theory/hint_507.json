    "problem": "What is the greatest possible number of digits in the product of a 4-digit whole number and a 3-digit whole number?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The greatest product of a 4-digit whole number and a 3-digit whole number is $(10^4-1)(10^3-1)=10^7-10^4-10^3+1=10^7-(10^4+10^3-1)$. $10^7$ has 8 digits and $10^4+10^3-1=11,000-1=10,999$ has 5 digits. Clearly, their difference (10,000,000-10,999) has $8-1=\\boxed{7}$ digits.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a 4-digit whole number is? What about a 3-digit whole number?\n2. How would you go about finding the product of a 4-digit whole number and a 3-digit whole number?\n3. What is the largest possible value for a 4-digit whole number? And for a 3-digit whole number?\n4. Can you multiply these two values together and determine the number of digits in the product?\n5. Is there a relationship between the number of digits in a product and the number of digits in the individual factors?\n6. What is the formula for finding the number of digits in a whole number?\n7. Using that formula, can you calculate the number of digits in the product we are interested in?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios where you would need to consider the number of digits in a product?"
