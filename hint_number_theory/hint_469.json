    "problem": "As $n$ ranges over the positive integers, what is the sum of all possible values of the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We can apply the Euclidean algorithm here.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(3n+4, n) &= \\gcd(n, 3n+4 - 3n) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n, 4).\n\\end{align*}There are three cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: $n$ is odd. Therefore, $n$ and 4 are relatively prime and have a greatest common divisor of 1.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is a multiple of 2, but not a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 share a common factor of 2. Since 4 has no other factors, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 2.\n\nCase 3: $n$ is a multiple of 4. In this case, $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 4.\n\nTherefore, the three possible values for the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ are 1, 2, and 4. It follows that the sum of all possible value of the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ is $1+2+4 = \\boxed{7}$.",

Can you describe the steps you took to simplify the expression $\\text{gcd}(3n + 4, n)$ using the Euclidean algorithm?\n3. What are the three cases that need to be considered based on the parity and divisibility of $n$?\n4. In Case 1, why are $n$ and 4 relatively prime? Can you provide an example for this case?\n5. In Case 2, why do $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 2? Can you provide an example for this case?\n6. In Case 3, why do $n$ and 4 have a greatest common divisor of 4? Can you provide an example for this case?\n7. What are all the possible values for the greatest common divisor of $3n+4$ and $n$ based on the three cases we've discussed?\n8. How can you determine the sum of all possible values of the greatest common divisor?\n9. Can you generalize this problem to find the sum of all possible values of the greatest common divisor for other expressions involving $n$?"
