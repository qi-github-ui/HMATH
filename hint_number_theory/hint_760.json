    "problem": "Let $f(n)$ be a function that, given an integer $n$, returns an integer $k$, where $k$ is the smallest possible integer such that $k!$ is divisible by $n$. Given that $n$ is a multiple of 15, what is the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $n = 15r$. Clearly, $r>14$, because $15!$ contains 15 as a factor and all integers less than 15 as factors. If $r=15$, then $n=225$, However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3s$, so $r > 15$. If $r=16$, then $n=240$. However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 2t$, so $r > 16$. If $r=17$, then $n = 255$. Note that $f(255) = 17$ because the smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 17 is $k = 17$, because 17 is prime. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 15 that fits the desired condition is $\\boxed{n = 255}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the function $f(n)$ defined as in relation to the integer $n$?\n2. How can we determine the smallest possible integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by $n$ using the function $f(n)$?\n3. If $n$ is a multiple of 15, what is the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n)$ is greater than 15?\n4. How can we express $n$ in terms of another variable to help find the smallest value that satisfies the condition?\n5. What is the relationship between $r$ and $n$ in the expression $n = 15r$?\n6. Why is it necessary to consider values of $r$ greater than 14 in order to satisfy the condition?\n7. How does the factorial function $k!$ relate to finding the smallest value of $k$ when it is divisible by a given number?\n8. Why do we need to check values of $r$ greater than 15, even though $n = 15r$ already satisfies the condition of being a multiple of 15?\n9. How does the primality of a number affect the value of $k$ in the function $f(n)$?\n10. Can you think of any other scenarios or problems where we can apply similar thinking and steps as we did in this question?"
