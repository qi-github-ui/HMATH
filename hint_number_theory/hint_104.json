    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The given information can be expressed by writing $x\\equiv 9^{-1}\\pmod{25}$. Thus we wish to compute $11+9^{-1}\\pmod{25}$.\n\nModulo $25$, we can write $11$ as $11\\cdot (9\\cdot 9^{-1}) \\equiv (11\\cdot 9)\\cdot 9^{-1} \\equiv 99\\cdot 9^{-1}$. Thus \\begin{align*}\n11 + 9^{-1} &\\equiv 99\\cdot 9^{-1} + 1\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 100\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\cdot 9^{-1} \\\\\n&\\equiv 0\\pmod{25},\n\\end{align*}so the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nNotice that the trick we used here is analogous to using a common denominator to add fractions.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means when we write $9x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}$?\n2. What does it mean for two numbers to be congruent modulo $25$?\n3. How can we express $9^{-1} \\pmod{25}$ in a more familiar form?\n4. Can you explain the reasoning behind rewriting $11$ as $11\\cdot(9\\cdot 9^{-1})$?\n5. Why are we able to substitute $99\\cdot 9^{-1}$ for $11+9^{-1}$?\n6. How do we simplify $99\\cdot 9^{-1} + 1\\cdot 9^{-1} \\pmod{25}$?\n7. How did we arrive at $100\\cdot 9^{-1} \\equiv 0\\pmod{25}$?\n8. Is there a general pattern or approach we can follow when finding remainders in similar problems?\n9. Can you think of any other scenarios where congruence modulo $25$ can be applied to find remainders?"
