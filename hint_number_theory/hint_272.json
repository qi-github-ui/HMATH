    "problem": "What is the least positive integer which when divided by 5 gives a remainder of 4, when divided by 6 gives a remainder of 5, when divided by 7 gives a remainder of 6, when divided by 8 gives a remainder of 7, when divided by 9 gives a remainder of 8, and when divided by 10 gives a remainder of 9?",

    "solution": "Suppose that $N$ is a positive integer satisfying all the given conditions. Note that since $N$ gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, $N+1$ must be divisible by 5. Similarly, $N+1$ is also divisible by 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Thus the least possible value for $N+1$ is the least common multiple of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Prime factorizing these numbers, we find that their least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 = 2520$. Thus the least possible value for $N$ is $\\boxed{2519}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you approach finding the least positive integer that satisfies the given conditions?\n2. What can we deduce about the value of the remainder when the integer is divided by 5, based on the information given?\n3. How does the concept of the least common multiple (LCM) connect with finding the least possible value for the integer?\n4. Can we determine the LCM of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10? If so, what is it?\n5. How is the LCM used to determine the least possible value for the integer satisfying the conditions?\n6. Are there any other ways or concepts similar to the approach used here that we can apply to solve similar problems?"
