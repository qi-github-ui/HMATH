    "problem": "For how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 349 inclusive does the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{350}$ terminate?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 350 as $2\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 7$, we see that $n/350$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 7. There are 49 multiples of 7 from 1 to 349, so there are $\\boxed{49}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{350}$ a terminating decimal.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you define what it means for a decimal representation to terminate? \n2. What are the prime factors of 350, and how do they relate to the question being asked? \n3. How can we determine if the decimal representation of n/350 terminates based on its factors? \n4. How many multiples of 7 are there between 1 and 349? \n5. What is the connection between the number of multiples of 7 and the number of possible values of n that make n/350 a terminating decimal? \n6. Can you think of any other examples where we can use prime factorization to determine if a decimal representation terminates?"
