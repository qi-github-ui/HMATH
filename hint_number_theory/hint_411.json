    "problem": "As $n$ ranges over the positive integers, what is the maximum possible value for the greatest common divisor of $11n+3$ and $6n+1$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We use the Euclidean Algorithm. \\begin{align*}\n\\gcd(11n+3, 6n+1) &= \\gcd(6n+1, (11n+3) - (6n+1)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(6n+1, 5n+2) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(5n+2, (6n+1)-(5n+2)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(5n+2, n-1) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n-1, (5n+2)-5(n-1)) \\\\\n&= \\gcd(n-1, 7).\n\\end{align*}Therefore, if $n-1$ is a multiple of 7, then the greatest common divisor of $11n+3$ and $6n+1$ is 7. Otherwise, the greatest common divisor is 1. This implies that the maximum possible value for the greatest common divisor of $11n+3$ and $6n+1$ is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving the problem using the Euclidean Algorithm?\n2. Are you familiar with what the Euclidean Algorithm is and how it works?\n3. Why do we subtract $(11n+3) - (6n+1)$ in the first step? What is the purpose of this subtraction?\n4. How does the Euclidean Algorithm help us find the greatest common divisor?\n5. Why do we express the greatest common divisor as $\\gcd(n-1, 7)$ in the final step?\n6. Can you think of any other situations where the Euclidean Algorithm might be useful in finding greatest common divisors?\n7. Are there any values of $n$ for which the greatest common divisor would not be 1 or 7? If so, what are they and why?"
