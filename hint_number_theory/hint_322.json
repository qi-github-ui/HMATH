    "problem": "Find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the reasoning behind trying a hundreds digit of 9? \n2. Why does the sum of the digits need to be divisible by 9?\n3. Can you clarify why the tens digit must be odd?\n4. How did you determine that 7 and 5 do not divide into the numbers 972 and 954?\n5. Can you explain why 3 and 6 divide into 936?\n6. Can you think of any other similar problems in number theory that require a similar approach?"
