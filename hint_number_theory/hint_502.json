    "problem": "How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "$343 = 7^3 = 1000_7$, so the first 343 natural numbers in base 7 are $1_7, 2_7, \\ldots 1000_7$.  Any number in this list that neither includes 4 or 5 only includes the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6.  If we replace 6 with 4, these have the same decimal expansions as the integers in base 5.  Since there are $5^3 = 125$ positive integers less than or equal to $1000_5$, there are 125 integers less than or equal to $1000_7$ that contain no 4's or 5's in base 7, which means there are $343 - 125 = \\boxed{218}$ integers that include a 4 or a 5.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given problem asking? Can you explain it in your own words?\n2. How can we represent the smallest positive integers in base 7? Can you provide some examples?\n3. How many digits are there in the base 7 representation of the number 343? What is the relationship between $7^3$ and 343?\n4. Which digits are allowed in the base 7 representation of a number that contains neither 4 nor 5? Can you provide some examples?\n5. What happens if we replace the digit 6 with 4 in the base 7 representation? How does this relate to base 5 representation?\n6. How many positive integers are there in base 5 that are less than or equal to 1000?\n7. If there are 125 positive integers in base 7 that contain no 4's or 5's, what can we conclude about the remaining integers?\n8. How can we determine the number of positive integers in base 7 that include a 4 or a 5?\n9. Based on your analysis, what is the final answer to the original problem?"
