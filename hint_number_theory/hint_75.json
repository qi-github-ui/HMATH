    "problem": "A total of 180 marbles (gray, white, and black) are placed in a line. The first five are gray, followed by four white, followed by three black, followed by five gray, followed by four white, followed by three black,.... If this pattern continues, what is the color of the 158th marble in this line?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We notice that the marbles appear in strings of 5 gray, 4 white, 3 black.  These strings have 12 marbles each.  Since  \\[158=13\\cdot12+2,\\]there are 13 full strings of marbles and 2 extras.  Since the first 5 marbles in any group are gray, the two extra marbles must be $\\boxed{\\text{gray}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the pattern in which the marbles are arranged? How many marbles are there in each repeating string of gray, white, and black?\n2. What is the total number of marbles in the first complete string of gray, white, and black? How many marbles are there in each of the three colors in this string?\n3. If you divide 158 by the number of marbles in each repeating string, what is the quotient? And what is the remainder?\n4. How does the quotient in the previous question help us determine the number of complete repeating strings of gray, white, and black that fit within the 158 marbles?\n5. How can we use the remainder in the previous question to determine the color of the 158th marble? Which specific color does it correspond to?\n6. Can you think of any other situations or problems where a similar thought process and steps might be applicable?"
