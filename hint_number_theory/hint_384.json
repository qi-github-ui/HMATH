    "problem": "A number is divisible by $8$ if the number formed by its last $3$ digits is divisible by $8.$ For example, the number $47\\,389\\,248$ is divisible by $8$ because $248$ is divisible by $8.$ However, $47\\,389\\,284$ is not divisible by $8$ because $284$ is not divisible by $8.$\n\nIf $992\\,466\\,1A6$ is divisible by $8,$ where $A$ represents one digit, what is the sum of the possible values of $A?$",

    "solution": "For $992\\,466\\,1A6$ to be divisible by $8,$ we must have $1A6$ divisible by $8.$ We check each of the possibilities, using a calculator or by checking by hand:\n\n$\\bullet$ $106$ is not divisible by $8,$ $116$ is not divisible by $8,$ $126$ is not divisible by $8,$\n\n$\\bullet$ $136$ is divisible by $8,$\n\n$\\bullet$ $146$ is not divisible by $8,$ $156$ is not divisible by $8,$ $166$ is not divisible by $8,$\n\n$\\bullet$ $176$ is divisible by $8,$\n\n$\\bullet$ $186$ is not divisible by $8,$ $196$ is not divisible by $8.$\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $A$ are $3$ and $7.$ Thus, the answer is $7+3=\\boxed{10}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the concept of divisibility by 8 and how it relates to the last 3 digits of a number?\n2. How does the example of $47,389,248$ help illustrate the concept of divisibility by 8?\n3. In the given number $992,466,1A6$, what digit(s) can replace the symbol A so that the number is divisible by 8?\n4. How can we determine if the three-digit number formed by the last three digits of $992,466,1A6$ is divisible by 8?\n5. Can you calculate the possible values of A by checking each possibility and determine if $1A6$ is divisible by 8 or not?\n6. Why are the numbers $136$ and $176$ the only possibilities for A in order for $992,466,1A6$ to be divisible by 8?\n7. Can you provide an explanation or reasoning behind your answer for the sum of the possible values of A being 10?"
