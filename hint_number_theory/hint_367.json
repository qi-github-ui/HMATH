    "problem": "How many integers between 0 and 8 inclusive have an inverse modulo 9?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "By inspection, we find that  \\begin{align*}\n1\\cdot 1 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{9} \\\\\n2\\cdot 5 &\\equiv1\\pmod{9} \\\\\n4\\cdot 7 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{9} \\\\\n8\\cdot 8 &\\equiv 1\\pmod{9}.\n\\end{align*}So 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have modular inverses (mod 9). Since no multiple of 0, 3, and 6 can be one more than a multiple of 9, we find that $\\boxed{6}$ of the modulo-9 residues have inverses.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is meant by \"inverse modulo 9\"?\n2. How might we determine the inverse modulo 9 for a given integer?\n3. By testing integers between 1 and 8, we found that 6 of them have inverses modulo 9. Is there a mathematical property or rule we can use to prove this without explicitly testing each integer?\n4. Can you provide an example of using modular inverse to solve a problem?\n5. What happens if an integer does not have an inverse modulo 9? Is it possible for an integer to have more than one inverse modulo 9?"
