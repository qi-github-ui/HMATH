    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since $2^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ and $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \\equiv b^c \\pmod{m}$ and $ad \\equiv bd \\pmod{m}$, $$2^{19}= (2^3)^6 \\cdot 2^1 \\equiv 1^6 \\cdot 2 \\equiv \\boxed{2} \\pmod{7}.$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the original problem asking us to find? \n2. What is the concept of remainders in modular arithmetic? \n3. How can we use modular arithmetic to compute remainders? \n4. What is $2^3$ congruent to modulo 7? How do we know this? \n5. How can we use this knowledge to simplify $2^{19}$? \n6. How does the concept of modular arithmetic and remainders relate to other areas of Number Theory? \n7. Can you think of other problems that can be solved using similar techniques?"
