    "problem": "It is currently $3\\!:\\!00\\!:\\!00 \\text{ p.m.}$ What time will it be in $6666$ seconds?  (Enter the time in the format \"HH:MM:SS\", without including \"am\" or \"pm\".)",

    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "There are $60$ seconds in a minute. When $6666$ is divided by $60$, you get $111$ with a remainder of $6$ seconds. Therefore, $6666$ seconds is $111$ minutes and $6$ seconds. There are $60$ minutes in an hour. When you divide $111$ by $60$, you get $1$ with a remainder of $51$. Thus, $6666$ seconds is equivalent to $1$ hour $51$ minutes and $6$ seconds. Therefore, the time in $6666$ seconds is $\\boxed{4\\!:\\!51\\!:\\!06 \\text{ p.m.}}$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of seconds in a minute?\n2. How many minutes are there in an hour?\n3. Can you calculate how many minutes are in 6666 seconds? What is the quotient and the remainder?\n4. How would you convert the minutes obtained in the previous step to hours and minutes? What is the resulting quotient and the remainder?\n5. Can you determine the time in the format \"HH:MM:SS\" after converting 6666 seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds?"
