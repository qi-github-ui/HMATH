    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Notice that $83^9+1$ and $83^9+83^2+1$ differ by $83^2$. Therefore, if they have a common divisor, then that divisor must also be a divisor of $83^2$. (To see why this is true, suppose $d$ is a divisor of $83^9+1$, so that $83^9+1 = dm$ for some integer $m$; also suppose that $d$ is a divisor of $83^9+83^2+1$, so that $83^9+83^2+1=dn$ for some integer $n$. Then $83^2=d(n-m)$.)\n\nSince $83$ is prime, the only (positive) divisors of $83^2$ are $1$, $83$, and $83^2$ itself. But $83$ cannot be a divisor of $83^9+1$ (which is clearly $1$ more than a multiple of $83$). Therefore, $\\gcd(83^9+1,83^9+83^2+1)=\\boxed{1}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain why we want to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $83^9+1$ and $83^9+83^2+1$?\n2. What can we say about the difference between $83^9+1$ and $83^9+83^2+1$?\n3. How does the difference between $83^9+1$ and $83^9+83^2+1$ help us determine the possible common divisors?\n4. What are the prime factors of $83^2$?\n5. Why can't $83$ be a divisor of $83^9+1$?\n6. Can you determine the gcd of $83^9+1$ and $83^9+83^2+1$ based on the given information? If so, what is the gcd?\n7. Can you think of any other similar problems where finding the gcd using similar reasoning and steps would be useful?"
