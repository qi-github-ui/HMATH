    "problem": "Convert $314_{10}$ to base 6.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The largest power of $6$ that is less than or equal to $314$ is $6^3$, which equals $216$. Because $(1\\cdot 6^3)=216<314<(2\\cdot 6^3)=432$, the digit in the $6^3$ place is $1$. Since $314-216=98$, we know that the digit in the $6^2$ place is $2$ because $72=2\\cdot 6^2<98<3\\cdot 6^2=108$. We then note that $98-72=26$, which can be expressed as $(4\\cdot6^1)+ (2\\cdot 6^0)$. Therefore the digit in the $6^1$ places is $4$, and the digit in the $6^0$ place is $2$.\n\nWe now see that $314_{10}=\\boxed{1242_6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the purpose of converting a number to a different base? Why would we want to do this?\n2. Can you explain how we determine the largest power of 6 that is less than or equal to 314? What is its value in this case?\n3. How do we determine the digit in the $6^3$ place? What is its value in this specific example?\n4. After determining the digit in the $6^3$ place, how do we proceed to find the digit in the $6^2$ place? What is its value in this example?\n5. How do we calculate the difference between 314 and the value of the digit in the $6^2$ place multiplied by $6^2$? What is its value in this case?\n6. Can you explain the reasoning behind expressing 26 as $(4\\cdot 6^1) + (2\\cdot 6^0)$? How did we determine the digit in the $6^1$ place and the digit in the $6^0$ place?\n7. Based on the previous steps, what is the final representation of $314_{10}$ in base 6? Please provide the complete answer."
