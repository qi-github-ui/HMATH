    "problem": "What integer $n$ satisfies $0\\le n<{101}$ and $$100n\\equiv 72\\pmod {101}~?$$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Notice that $100\\equiv-1\\pmod{101}$.  Therefore if we have any multiple of 100, that number will be congruent to the negative of the number we get by deleting the final two zeros and changing the sign.  For example \\[111100\\equiv-1111\\pmod{101}.\\]In particular, $100n\\equiv -n\\pmod{101}$.  Therefore we want to solve \\[-n\\equiv72\\pmod{101},\\]or \\[n\\equiv-72\\pmod{101}.\\]Adding 101 does not change the residue class, so this is equivalent to \\[n\\equiv \\boxed{29}\\pmod{101}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given congruence equation and its modulo value?\n2. How can we rewrite the expression $100n$ in terms of its modulo value?\n3. Based on the given relation $100\\equiv-1\\pmod{101}$, what can we conclude about the congruence equation?\n4. What is the simplified congruence equation we want to solve?\n5. How can we find the value of $n$ in the simplified congruence equation?\n6. Can we add or subtract any value to the congruence equation without changing its solution set?\n7. What is the final solution for the congruence equation?\n8. Is there any other integer value for $n$ that satisfies the given congruence equation?"
