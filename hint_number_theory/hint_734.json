    "problem": "An abundant number is a positive integer such that the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. The number 12 is an abundant number since $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 > 12$. What is the smallest abundant number that is not a multiple of 6?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For any prime number, the sum of its proper divisors is equal to $1$, so a prime number cannot be an abundant number. Therefore, it suffices to check the smallest composite numbers that are not divisible by $6$. We find that:\n\n$\\bullet$ for $4$, $1 + 2 < 4$,\n$\\bullet$ for $8$, $1 + 2 + 4 < 8$,\n$\\bullet$ for $9$, $1 + 3 < 9$,\n$\\bullet$ for $10$, $1 + 2 + 5 < 10$,\n$\\bullet$ for $14$, $1 + 2 + 7< 14$,\n$\\bullet$ for $15$, $1 + 3 + 5< 15$,\n$\\bullet$ for $16$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 < 16$,\n$\\bullet$ for $20$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22 > 20$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{20}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you define what an abundant number is?\n2. How do we determine if a number is abundant?\n3. Can you explain the concept of proper divisors?\n4. Why is the sum of proper divisors important in determining if a number is abundant?\n5. Why do we only need to check composite numbers that are not divisible by 6?\n6. What is the process for finding the smallest abundant number that meets the given conditions?"
