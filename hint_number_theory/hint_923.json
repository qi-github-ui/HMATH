    "problem": "For how many bases between two and nine inclusive does the representation of $576_{10}$ have a final digit of 1?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For 576 to have a final digit of 1 when represented in base $b$, we must have that $576-1$ is divisible by $b$. To see this, note that any integer whose base-$b$ representation ends in 0 is divisible by $b$, just as any integer whose decimal representation ends in 0 is divisible by 10.  Since $575 = 5^2 \\cdot 23$, the only base which satisfies the given condition is 5.  Therefore, there is $\\boxed{1}$ such base.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for a number to have a final digit of 1 in a particular base?\n2. Based on the given information, what condition must be met for the representation of 576 in base b to have a final digit of 1?\n3. How can we determine if a number is divisible by another number in general? Can you apply this to the specific case of determining if 576 - 1 is divisible by a certain base?\n4. Can you factorize the number 575 = 5^2 * 23? What role does this play in finding the bases that satisfy the given condition?\n5. Why is the base 5 the only one that satisfies the condition? Can you explain the reasoning behind this?\n6. Can you think of any other scenarios or problems where similar reasoning and steps may be used to find the desired solution?"
