    "problem": "Two farmers agree that pigs are worth $\\$300$ and that goats are worth $\\$210$. When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with ``change'' received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary. (For example, a $\\$390$ debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If a debt of $D$ dollars can be resolved in this way, then integers $p$ and $g$ must exist with \\[\nD = 300p + 210g = 30(10p + 7g).\n\\]As a consequence, $D$ must be a multiple of 30, and  no positive debt less than $\\$30$ can be resolved. A debt of  $\\boxed{\\$30}$  can be resolved since \\[\n30 = 300(-2) + 210(3).\n\\]This is  done by giving 3 goats and receiving 2 pigs.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem statement asking us to find?\n2. What are the given values in the problem, and how do they relate to each other?\n3. What is the equation that relates the number of pigs and goats to the debt owed?\n4. Why does the debt have to be a multiple of 30 in order to be resolved in this way?\n5. What is the significance of the example that shows a debt of $\\$30$ being resolved?\n6. Can you think of any other situations where this type of problem could arise, and how would you approach them using the same method?"
