    "problem": "In a physical education class, students line up in four rows to do exercises. One particular class has over 30 students, with three rows having the same number of students and one row having one more student than the other three rows. What is the smallest possible class size for this physical education class?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If the first three rows have 1 student, the last row must have two students, so there are 5 students in total. This is not greater than 30, so we must add another student to each row. This gives 9, which is still not greater than 30. We have to keep adding 4 until we get to a number greater than 30. As a result, we reach 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33. 33 is the first integer greater than 30, so this class has $\\boxed{33}$ students.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the problem and what you need to find?\n2. If the first three rows have 1 student each, how many students are in the last row?\n3. Is it possible for the total number of students to be less than 30 in this case?\n4. What happens if we add another student to each row, making a total of 9 students?\n5. Is the total number of students still less than 30 after adding one student to each row?\n6. What happens if we continue adding 4 students to each row? Can you keep track of the total number of students?\n7. At what number of students does the total become greater than 30?\n8. Is there any smaller total number of students that satisfies the given conditions?\n9. Can you explain why the smallest possible class size is 33, based on your previous findings?"
