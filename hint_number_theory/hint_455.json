    "problem": "A certain integer has $4$ digits when written in base $8$. The same integer has $d$ digits when written in base $2$. What is the sum of all possible values of $d$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The smallest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $1000_8$, which stands for $8^3 = 2^9$. The largest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $7777_8$, which is $1$ less than $10000_8$ and therefore stands for $8^4-1 = 2^{12}-1$.\n\nThus, when a $4$-digit base-$8$ integer is written in base $2$, its highest place value is either $2^9$, $2^{10}$, or $2^{11}$. It follows that the base-$2$ expression has $10$, $11$, or $12$ digits, so the sum of all possible values for $d$ is $10+11+12 = \\boxed{33}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information about the integer in question and how is it represented in base 8?\n2. How can we determine the number of digits the integer has when written in base 2 based on the information about its base 8 representation?\n3. What are the possible values for the highest place value in the base-2 expression and how do we arrive at them?\n4. How does the value of the highest place value affect the number of total digits in the base-2 expression?\n5. What is the smallest possible value for the number of digits in the base-2 expression and how do we arrive at it?\n6. What is the largest possible value for the number of digits in the base-2 expression and how do we arrive at it?\n7. How do we find the sum of all possible values for the number of digits in the base-2 expression?\n8. Does the sum of all possible values make sense in the context of the problem, and why or why not?\n9. Can we generalize this process to similar problems involving different bases and numbers of digits? If so, how?"
