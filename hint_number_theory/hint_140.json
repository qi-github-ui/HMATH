    "problem": "In base $b$, there are exactly one hundred three-digit numbers whose digits are all distinct. (That's \"one hundred\" in the ordinary sense, $100_{10}$.)\n\nWhat is $b$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "To form a three-digit number in base $b$ whose digits are all distinct, we must choose a first digit, a second digit, and a third digit. We have $b-1$ choices for the first digit ($1,2,3,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$). We have $b-1$ choices for the second digit ($0,1,2,\\ldots,b-2,b-1$, with the first digit removed from our choices). We have $b-2$ choices for the third digit. So, $$(b-1)^2(b-2) = 100.$$Trial and error is arguably the most reasonable way to solve this equation! Since $100=5\\cdot 5\\cdot 4$, the answer is $b=\\boxed{6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many total digits are in a three-digit number in base $b$ with distinct digits?\n2. What are the possible choices for the first digit? How many choices are there?\n3. After choosing the first digit, what are the possible choices for the second digit? How many choices are there?\n4. How many choices are left for the third digit? Why?\n5. Can you express the number of three-digit numbers with distinct digits in terms of $b$?\n6. How can we find the value of $b$ given the equation $(b-1)^2(b-2) = 100$?\n7. Can you list all the possible values of $b$ that satisfy the equation?\n8. Why do we only consider the positive solutions for $b$ in this case?\n9. What does it mean for a base $b$ to have exactly one hundred three-digit numbers with distinct digits?\n10. Can you think of other scenarios or problems where considering distinct digits and a particular base would be relevant?"
