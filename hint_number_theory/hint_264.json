    "problem": "How many positive two-digit integers leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Our goal is to count the two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ for integer values of $n$.  We examine the inequality, $$ 10 \\le 8n + 2 < 100. $$Subtracting 2 from all parts simplifies things: $$ 8 \\le 8n < 98. $$Dividing everything by 8 isolates the possible values of $n$: $$ 1 \\le n < 12\\, \\frac{1}{4}. $$Since $n$ can be any integer from 1 to 12, there are $\\boxed{12}$ two-digit integers in the form $8n + 2$ (that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8).",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what we are trying to count in this problem? What are the characteristics of the numbers we are interested in?\n2. How can we represent a two-digit integer that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 8? Can you write it as an equation or inequality?\n3. What steps can we take to isolate the possible values of the variable in the equation or inequality?\n4. Why do we subtract 2 from both sides of the inequality? What does this help us achieve?\n5. How does dividing by 8 help us find the possible values of the variable? Can you explain the reasoning behind this step?\n6. Can you identify the range of values for the variable that satisfies the inequality? What is the significance of the fractional part in the range?\n7. What is the final step to determine the number of two-digit integers that meet the given condition? How can we use the range of values for the variable to find this number?"
