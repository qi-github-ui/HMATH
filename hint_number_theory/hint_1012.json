    "solution": "The numbers $A-B$ and $A+B$ are both odd or both even. However, they are also both prime, so they must both be odd. Therefore, one of $A$ and $B$ is odd and the other even. Because $A$ is a prime between $A-B$ and $A+B,$ $A$ must be the odd prime. Therefore, $B=2,$ the only even prime. So $A-2,$ $A,$ and $A+2$ are consecutive odd primes and thus must be $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ The sum of the four primes $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7$ is the prime number $17,$ so the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(E)},}$ prime.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information in the problem and what is the desired outcome?\n2. Why must $A-B$ and $A+B$ both be odd or both be even, and how does this knowledge help us in the problem?\n3. How do we know that $A$ is the odd prime and $B=2$, and what does this tell us about the values of $A-B$, $A$, $A+2$ and $A+B$?\n4. Why must $A-2$, $A$, and $A+2$ be consecutive odd primes, and what is the significance of this observation?\n5. What is the sum of the four primes $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$? How did we arrive at this sum?\n6. Is the sum of the four primes even, divisible by $3$, divisible by $5$, divisible by $7$, or prime? How do we know?\n7. Can this method be used to solve similar problems in number theory? If so, what types of problems would this be useful for?"
