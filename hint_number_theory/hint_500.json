    "problem": "A roll of quarters contains $40$ quarters and a roll of dimes contains $50$ dimes. James has a jar that contains $83$ quarters and $159$ dimes.  Lindsay has a jar that contains $129$ quarters and $266$ dimes. James and Lindsay pool these quarters and dimes and make complete rolls with as many of the coins as possible. In dollars, how much are the leftover quarters and dimes worth?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We use residues of the numbers of each type of coin to determine the number of dimes and quarters leftover: $$ \\begin{array}{rcrcr} 83 + 129 &\\equiv& 3 + 9 &\\equiv& 12 \\pmod{40} \\\\ 159 + 266 &\\equiv& 9 + 16 &\\equiv& 25 \\pmod{50} \\end{array} $$ The total value of the leftover quarters and dimes is $$ 12(\\$0.25) + 25(\\$0.10) = \\$3.00 + \\$2.50 = \\boxed{\\$5.50}. $$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the given quantities in the problem and what is the problem asking us to find? \n2. How can we determine the number of leftover dimes and quarters for James and Lindsay? \n3. Why do we use residues modulo $40$ and $50$ in determining the number of leftover coins? \n4. Can we use a different modulus besides $40$ and $50$? If so, which moduli would work and why? \n5. How do we calculate the value of leftover coins using the given information about the number of leftover dimes and quarters? \n6. Can we generalize this problem to larger amounts of coins or different denominations? If so, how would the solution method change? \n7. Are there any assumptions we are making about the coins (e.g. no rare or unusual coins) that affect the validity of our solution?"
