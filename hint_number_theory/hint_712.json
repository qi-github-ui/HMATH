How can we simplify the expression $11^5$ in mod 9? What property or rule can we apply?\n4. What is the remainder when $2^5$ is divided by 9? How did we arrive at this result?\n5. Can you think of any other examples where modular arithmetic can be used as a problem-solving strategy?\n6. How can we verify that our answer of $n=5$ is correct? Is there a way to double-check our solution?"
