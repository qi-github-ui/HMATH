    "problem": "For how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 1000 inclusive does the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{1400}$ terminate?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $1400$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $7$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1000}{7}\\right\\rfloor=142$ multiples of $7$ between $1$ and $1000$, so there are $\\boxed{142}$ integers values for $n$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for the decimal representation of a fraction to terminate or not terminate?\n2. What is the prime factorization of 1400? Why is this important for determining when the decimal representation of a fraction simplifies?\n3. How do we know that in order for the fraction $\\frac{n}{1400}$ to simplify to having only the primes 2 and 5 in the denominator, there must be a factor of 7 in the numerator?\n4. How many multiples of 7 are there between 1 and 1000? Why is this relevant for determining the number of integer values of n between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{1400}$ terminates?\n5. Can you explain why the answer to the problem is equal to the number of multiples of 7 between 1 and 1000? Is there any other way to approach this problem?"
