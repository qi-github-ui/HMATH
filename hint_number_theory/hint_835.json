    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We would like to find $b$ for which $b^3 \\leq 197_{10} < b^4.$ We can see that this inequality is satisfied for $4\\leq b \\leq 5.$ So, there are $\\boxed{2}$ bases for which this holds.",

What is the relationship between the exponent of the base and the number of digits in the representation? \n7. How can we determine the possible values for $b$ based on the given conditions? \n8. Can you explain how the inequality $b^3 \\leq 197_{10} < b^4$ helps us find the range of possible values for $b$? \n9. Why do we consider the range from $4$ to $5$ for $b$? \n10. How many values of $b$ satisfy the given conditions?"
