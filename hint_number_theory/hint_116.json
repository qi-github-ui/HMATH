    "problem": "What is the product of all the positive integer divisors of 12?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For every divisor $d$ of $12$, then $12/d$ is also a divisor of $12$. Their product is $d \\cdot (12/d) = 12$. It follows that every divisor can be paired with another divisor of $12$ such that their product is $12 = 2^2 \\cdot 3$. There are $(2+1)(1+1) = 6$ divisors of $12$: $1,2,3,4,6,12$. Thus, the product of the divisors is given by $12^{6/2} = 12^3 = \\boxed{1728}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you list out all the divisors of 12? \n2. How can you pair up the divisors of 12 such that their product is equal to 12? \n3. What is the total number of divisors of 12, and how did you arrive at this number? \n4. Can you explain why the product of all the divisors of 12 is equal to $12^{(n/2)}$, where n is the total number of divisors of 12? \n5. Can you apply this same reasoning to find the product of all the positive integer divisors of any other number? \n6. What other interesting properties do divisors of numbers have?"
