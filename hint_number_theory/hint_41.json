    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The identity $\\gcd(k,\\ell)\\cdot\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = k\\ell$ holds for all positive integers $k$ and $\\ell$. Thus, we have $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[k,\\ell] = \\frac{k\\ell}{3}.$$Also, $k$ and $\\ell$ must be 4-digit multiples of $3$, so our choices for each are $$1002,1005,1008,1011,1014,\\ldots,$$and by minimizing the product $k\\ell$, we minimize the least common multiple of $k$ and $\\ell$. However, $k$ and $\\ell$ cannot both be $1002$, since their greatest common divisor would then be $1002$ (not $3$). Setting $k=1002$ and $\\ell=1005$, we obtain $\\gcd(k,\\ell)=3$ as desired, and we obtain the smallest possible value for the least common multiple: \\begin{align*}\n\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[1002,1005] &= \\frac{1002\\cdot 1005}{3} \\\\\n&= 1002\\cdot 335 \\\\\n&= (1000\\cdot 335)+(2\\cdot 335)\\\\\n&= \\boxed{335{,}670}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. What does it mean for two numbers to have a greatest common divisor? How can we find it?\n3. How is the least common multiple related to the product of two numbers and their greatest common divisor? Why does the identity hold?\n4. Based on the information given, what restrictions do we have on the possible values for $k$ and $\\ell$?\n5. How can we minimize the least common multiple in this case? What values of $k$ and $\\ell$ would give us the smallest possible least common multiple?\n6. Is it possible to choose $k$ and $\\ell$ both as $1002$? Why or why not?\n7. By setting $k=1002$ and $\\ell=1005$, can you calculate the least common multiple for these values? What is the smallest possible value for the least common multiple in this case?"
