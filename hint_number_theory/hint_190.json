    "problem": "How many positive integers less than 1000 are congruent to 6 (mod 11)?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The least positive integer which is congruent to 6 (mod 11) is 6. The other positive integers which are congruent to 6 (mod 11) are $6+11$, $6+22$, $6+33$, and so on. We seek the maximum positive integer $k$ for which $6+11k<1000$. This maximal $k$ is the greatest integer less than $\\frac{1000-6}{11}$, which is 90. So the set of positive integers less than 1000 which are congruent to 6 (mod 11) is  $$\n\\{11(0)+6, 11(1)+6, 11(2)+6, \\ldots, 11(90)+6\\},\n$$and there are $\\boxed{91}$ elements in this set (since there are 91 elements in the set $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,90\\}$).",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean for a number to be congruent to 6 (mod 11)?\n2. Can you provide an example of a number that satisfies the congruence condition?\n3. How can we find all the positive integers less than 1000 that satisfy the congruence condition?\n4. What is the least positive integer that satisfies the congruence condition?\n5. How can we find the next positive integer that satisfies the condition?\n6. Can you identify a pattern in the series of numbers that satisfy the congruence condition?\n7. How can we determine the maximum positive integer that satisfies the congruence condition but is still less than 1000?\n8. Can you calculate the number of positive integers that satisfy the congruence condition based on the maximum value found in the previous question?\n9. Is there a general formula or approach we can use to solve similar problems involving congruences?\n10. Can you think of another example where we can apply similar reasoning and steps to find the desired solution?"
