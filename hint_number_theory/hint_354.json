    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what is meant by \"base $h$\" in this equation? \n2. How many possible values of $h$ are there in this problem? \n3. Why is it important to note that the two rightmost columns do not require carrying? \n4. Why is there a residue of $1$ in the third column of the solution? \n5. Can you describe the process of subtracting $1$ from the sum of $4$ and $5$ and why it leads to the value of $h$? \n6. Can you think of any other examples where the concept of base is important in solving a problem?"
