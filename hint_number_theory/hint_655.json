    "problem": "A marathon is $26$ miles and $385$ yards. One mile equals $1760$ yards.\n\nLeila has run ten marathons in her life. If the total distance Leila covered in these marathons is $m$ miles and $y$ yards, where $0\\le y<1760$, what is the value of $y$?",

    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If one marathon equals $26$ miles and $385$ yards, then ten marathons equal $260$ miles and $3850$ yards. Those $3850$ yards can be broken down as $2$ miles and $3850 - (2\\cdot 1760) = 3850 - 3520 = 330$ yards. Therefore, $y=\\boxed{330}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total distance Leila covered in ten marathons?\n2. How many yards are in one mile?\n3. Can you convert the total distance Leila covered in ten marathons from miles and yards to just yards?\n4. What does the remaining yards of $y$ represent in this problem?\n5. How can you break down the remaining yards into miles and yards? \n6. What is the final value of $y$ and how do you get it? \n7. If Leila wanted to run a total of 1000 miles, how many marathons would she need to complete?"
