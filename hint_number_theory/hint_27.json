    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We can use the Euclidean Algorithm. \\begin{align*}\n&\\text{gcd}\\,(a^2+9a+24,a+4) \\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(a^2+9a+24-(a+5)(a+4),a+4)\\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(a^2+9a+24-(a^2+9a+20),a+4)\\\\\n&\\qquad=\\text{gcd}\\,(4,a+4).\n\\end{align*} Since $4$ is a factor of $a$ and thus $a+4$, the greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the reasoning behind using the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor in this problem?\n2. What is the significance of subtracting $(a+5)(a+4)$ from $a^2+9a+24$ in the Euclidean Algorithm calculation?\n3.
