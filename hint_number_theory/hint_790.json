    "problem": "What is the greatest common divisor of $2^{1001}-1$ and $2^{1012}-1$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\n&\\text{gcd}\\,(2^{1012}-1, 2^{1001}-1) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}\\, (2^{1012}-1 - 2^{11}(2^{1001}-1), 2^{1001}-1) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}\\,(2^{11}-1, 2^{1001}-1)\n\\end{align*} Using the divisibility rule for $11$, we know that $11$ divides into $1001$. Writing $2^{1001}$ as $(2^{11})^{91}$ and $1$ as $1^{91}$, we use the difference of odd powers factorization to find that   \\[\n2^{1001} - 1 = (2^{11})^{91}-1^{91} = (2^{11}-1)((2^{11})^{90} + (2^{11})^{89}+\\cdots (2^{11})^1 + 1).\n\\] Thus $2^{1001}-1$ is divisible by $2^{11}-1$, so the greatest common divisor is $2^{11}-1 = \\boxed{2047}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step to solve this problem using the Euclidean algorithm?\n2. What is the application of the Euclidean algorithm in finding the greatest common divisor?\n3. How does the Euclidean algorithm work, and what is the logic behind each step?\n4. What is the relationship between the difference of powers factorization and divisibility by 11?\n5. Can you provide an example of another problem where the Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the greatest common divisor?\n6. How can we verify that our answer, 2047, is indeed the greatest common divisor of $2^{1001}-1$ and $2^{1012}-1$?\n7. Are there any other methods you can think of to find the greatest common divisor of these two numbers? How do they compare to using the Euclidean algorithm?"
