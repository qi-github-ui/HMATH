    "solution": "We use the Euclidean algorithm.  \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(5616,11609)&=\\text{gcd}\\,(5616 ,11609- 2 \\cdot 5616) \\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(5616, 377)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(5616-14 \\cdot 377,377)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(338,377)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(338,377-338)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(338,39)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(338 - 8 \\cdot 39,39)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(26,39).\n\\end{align*}We can easily find that the greatest common divisor of $26$ and $39$ is $\\boxed{13}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the process for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm?\n2. Are there any specific requirements or limitations on the two numbers when using the Euclidean algorithm to find their greatest common divisor?\n3. Can we use any other method to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers? If so, what are they and how do they compare to the Euclidean algorithm?\n4. How can we apply the concept of greatest common divisor in solving real-world problems, such as finding the largest common denominator in simplifying fractions?\n5. Can the Euclidean algorithm be extended to find the greatest common divisor of more than two numbers? If so, how? If not, what other methods can we use?"
