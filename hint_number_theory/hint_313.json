    "problem": "What are the rightmost three digits of $5^{1993}$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We compute the powers of 5 modulo 1000: \\begin{align*}\n5^0&\\equiv1\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^1&\\equiv5\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^2&\\equiv25\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^3&\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^4&\\equiv625\\pmod{1000}\\\\\n5^5&\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}.\n\\end{align*} This pattern repeats every two terms starting at the 4th term.  In particular, when $n>2$, and $n$ is odd,  \\[5^n\\equiv125\\pmod{1000}.\\] Therefore the rightmost digit of $5^{1993}$ is $\\boxed{125}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step to approach this problem?\n2. What methods do you know for computing powers of a number modulo another number?\n3. If you were to use the method of computing powers of 5 modulo 1000, how would you identify the pattern or cycle?\n4. Why does this pattern repeat every two terms starting at the 4th term?\n5. How can you determine the rightmost digit of $5^{1993}$ based on the pattern you've identified?\n6. Can you think of any other problems or equations that might require a similar approach or thinking process?"
