    "problem": "When the base-10 integers 200 and 1200 are expressed in base 2, how many more digits does 1200 have than 200 (after being converted)?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The largest power of 2 less than 1200 is $2^{10}=1024$, and the largest power of 2 less than 200 is $2^7=128$. So, we know that 1200 in base 2 will be a 1 in the $2^{10}$ place followed by other digits, and 200 in base 2 will be a 1 in the $2^7$ place followed by other digits. Since $2^{10}$ is 3 places away from $2^7$, 1200 will have $\\boxed{3}$ more digits than 200 in their base-2 representations.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the process of converting base-10 integers to base-2? What are the steps involved?\n2. How do we determine the largest power of 2 less than a given base-10 number? Can you apply this method to find the largest powers of 2 less than 200 and 1200?\n3. What is the significance of the largest power of 2 in the base-2 representation of a number? How does it affect the overall number of digits?\n4. Based on the largest powers of 2 we found for 200 and 1200, can you identify the position of the \"1\" in their respective base-2 representations? What other digits follow this \"1\"?\n5. How can we determine the number of additional digits in the base-2 representation of 1200 compared to 200? What is the relationship between the positions of the largest power of 2 for both numbers?\n6. Can you think of any other situations where we might compare the number of digits in different base-2 representations? How does the process of finding the number of extra digits apply to these situations?"
