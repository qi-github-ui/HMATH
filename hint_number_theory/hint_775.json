    "solution": "We can use the Euclidean Algorithm. The closest multiple of $2a+9$ that we can spot to $6a^2 + 49a + 108$ is $6a^2 + 49a + 99 = (2a+9)(3a+11),$ so we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108,2a+9)\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108-(2a+9)(3a+11),2a+9)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(6a^2+49a+108-(6a^2+49a+99),2a+9)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(9,2a+9).\n\\end{align*}Since $7767$ is a multiple of 9, both $2a$ and $9$ are multiples of $9$, $2a+9$ is also a multiple of $9$ so the greatest common divisor is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain why we need to use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor in this problem?\n2. How did you determine that the closest multiple of $2a+9$ to $6a^2 + 49a + 108$ is $6a^2 + 49a + 99$?\n3. Can you give a step-by-step explanation of how you used the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor?\n4. How did you simplify the expression $6a^2+49a+108-(2a+9)(3a+11)$ to reach the next step?\n5. Why is the greatest common divisor of $6a^2+49a+108$ and $2a+9$ the same as the greatest common divisor of $9$ and $2a+9$?\n6. Under what condition does $2a+9$ become a multiple of $9$?\n7. Is it possible to use a different method to find the greatest common divisor in this problem? If so, what other methods could be used?\n8. Can you think of any other number theory concepts or problems that can be explored using similar reasoning and steps as used in this problem?"
