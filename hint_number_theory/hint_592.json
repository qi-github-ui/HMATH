    "problem": "If $0.8= \\frac{y}{186+x}$, find the smallest value of $x$, if $x$ and $y$ are positive integers.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Note that $0.8 = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$, so $\\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{y}{186+x}$. As $x$ is positive, we want to find the smallest number greater than $186$ which is a multiple of $5$. This number is 190, which implies $\\boxed{x=4}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we rewrite the fraction 0.8 as a simplified form?\n2. What does it mean for two fractions to be equal? How can we use that in our problem?\n3. What does the equation $\\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{y}{186+x}$ tell us about the relationship between $y$ and $186+x$?\n4. If $x$ is a positive integer, what is the smallest value it can have?\n5. How can we find the value of $x$ that satisfies $\\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{y}{186+x}$ while also being the smallest positive integer?\n6. Are there any restrictions or conditions for $y$ in this problem?\n7. How can we determine the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation by considering the factors of 186+x and the numerator of the fraction?\n8. How does the fact that $\\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$ help us find the solution to the equation?\n9. Can we generalize this problem and apply similar concepts to other equations involving fractions and unknown variables?"
