    "problem": "What is the modular inverse of $11$, modulo $1000$?\n\nExpress your answer as an integer from $0$ to $999$, inclusive.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We know that the modular inverse exists because $11$ and $1000$ are relatively prime. Notice that $1000 = 10^3$ and that $11 = 10 + 1$. Since $11 \\cdot 11^{-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}$, it follows that $(10+1) \\cdot 11^{-1} = 10^3k + 1$ for some integer $k$. We recognize the potential sum of cubes factorization: if $k=1$, then $$10^3 + 1 = 1001 = 11 \\cdot (10^2 - 10 + 1) = 11 \\cdot 91.$$Thus, $11^{-1} \\equiv \\boxed{91} \\pmod{1000}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a modular inverse is and why it is important in Number Theory?\n2. How can we determine whether a modular inverse exists for a given number modulo another number?\n3. In this specific problem, why do we know that the modular inverse of 11 exists modulo 1000?\n4. Can you describe the relationship between 10^3 and 11 in terms of their modular inverse?\n5. What is the potential sum of cubes factorization that can be used to find the modular inverse of 11?\n6. How did we choose the value of k in the expression (10+1)\u00b711^(-1) = 10^3k + 1?\n7. Can you verify that 11^(-1) \u2261 91 (mod 1000) is indeed the correct answer by performing the necessary multiplication?"
