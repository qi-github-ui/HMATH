    "problem": "Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $a-b=6$ and $\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right) = 9$. Find the smallest possible value of $b$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Recall that $a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$. By the Euclidean Algorithm, we obtain: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\left(\\frac{a^3+b^3}{a+b}, ab\\right) &= \\text{gcd}(a^2-ab+b^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(a^2-2ab+b^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}((a-b)^2, ab) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}(36, ab).\n\\end{align*}Thus, $\\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$. Trying values of $b$,  we find that $b = 1 \\Rightarrow a=7$ and $ab = 7\\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 1$. If $b = 2$, then $a=8$ and $ab=16 \\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 4$. Finally, $b = 3 \\Rightarrow a=9$ and $ab=27 \\Rightarrow \\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$. Therefore, the minimum possible value for $b$ is  $\\boxed{3}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What do we know about the given equation and conditions? Can you summarize them?\n2. How can we leverage the Euclidean Algorithm to simplify the expression inside the gcd function?\n3. What is the significance of the gcd becoming 9? What does it imply about the relationship between $36$ and $ab$?\n4. Can we narrow down the possible values of $b$ by considering different values of $a$ and calculating $ab$?\n5. How can we determine if a specific value of $b$ satisfies the condition $\\text{gcd}(36, ab) = 9$?\n6. Considering all the possible values of $b$ obtained, which one yields the smallest possible value?"
