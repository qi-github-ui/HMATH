    "problem": "How many positive three-digit integers are divisible by both 11 and 5?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "To be divisible by both 5 and 11, an integer must be a multiple of 55.  The smallest three-digit multiple of 55 is $2 \\cdot 55 = 110,$ and the largest three-digit multiple of 55 is $18 \\cdot 55 = 990$. So we can count the number of integers by the number of multiples, $2, 3, \\ldots , 17 , 18$, of which there are $\\boxed{17}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain why an integer must be a multiple of 55 to be divisible by both 5 and 11?\n2. How many multiples of 55 are there between 100 and 999?\n3. Can you explain why we only need to consider the multiples of 55 between 110 and 990?\n4. How did you calculate the number of multiples of 55 between 110 and 990?\n5. Are there any other integers that are divisible by both 5 and 11? Why or why not?\n6. If we wanted to find the number of positive four-digit integers that are divisible by both 11 and 5, how would our approach be different?"
