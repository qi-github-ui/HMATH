If $x$ satisfies both of the congruences in question 2, what can we say about $x$ modulo 20? \n4. How do we find the remainder when $x^2$ is divided by 20, given the information above? \n5. Are there any other methods or shortcuts to solve the problem of finding remainders of squares modulo a certain number? \n6. Can you think of other examples where modular arithmetic and solving linear congruences can be useful in number theory?"
