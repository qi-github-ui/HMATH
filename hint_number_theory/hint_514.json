    "problem": "When the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two integers are multiplied, the product is 180. How many different values could be the greatest common divisor of the two integers?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  Hence, in this case, $ab = 180$.  The prime factorization of 180 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, so $a = 2^p \\cdot 3^q \\cdot 5^r$ and $b = 2^s \\cdot 3^t \\cdot 5^u$ for some nonnegative integers $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$, $t$, and $u$.  Then $ab = 2^{p + s} \\cdot 3^{q + t} \\cdot 5^{r + u}$.  But $ab = 180 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, so $p + s = 2$, $q + t = 2$, and $r + u = 1$.\n\nWe know that $\\gcd(a,b) = 2^{\\min\\{p,s\\}} \\cdot 3^{\\min\\{q,t\\}} \\cdot 5^{\\min\\{r,u\\}}$.  The possible pairs $(p,s)$ are $(0,2)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{p,s\\}$ are 0 and 1.  The possible pairs $(q,t)$ are $(0,2)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{q,t\\}$ are 0 and 1.  The possible pairs $(r,u)$ are $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$, so the only possible value of $\\min\\{r,u\\}$ is 0.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $\\gcd(a,b)$ are $2^0 \\cdot 3^0 = 1$, $2^1 \\cdot 3^0 = 2$, $2^0 \\cdot 3^1 = 3$, and $2^1 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$, for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ possible values.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. How can we use the relationship between the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple to approach this problem? \n3. What is the prime factorization of 180 and how can we use it to determine the possible values of the greatest common divisor in this case?\n4. How does the relationship between the prime factorization of 180 and the factors in the prime factorization of the two integers help us determine the possible values of the greatest common divisor?\n5. What are the possible pairs of exponents (p, s), (q, t), and (r, u) in the prime factorization of the two integers, and how do they relate to the possible values of the greatest common divisor?\n6. Are there any restrictions on the possible exponents in the prime factorization of the two integers, and if so, how do they affect the possible values of the greatest common divisor?\n7. What are the possible values of the greatest common divisor based on the possible exponents in the prime factorization of the two integers?\n8. How many different values could be the greatest common divisor of the two integers based on the possible values from the previous step?"
