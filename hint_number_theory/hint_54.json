    "problem": "For how many positive integers $n$ does $\\frac{1}{n}$ yield a terminating decimal with a non-zero hundredths digit?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Note that the numbers whose decimal representations begin $0.00\\ldots$ are the positive real numbers less than $1/100$. Therefore, the hundredths digit of $1/n$ is zero for all $n > 100$. Also, recall that $1/n$ is a terminating decimal if and only if $n$ is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The fifteen integers up to 100 whose prime factorizations contain only twos and fives are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 64, 80, and 100. One way to generate this list systematically is to consider integers of the form $2^m5^n$, starting with $n=0$ and $m=0,1,2,3,4,5,6$, then $n=1$ and $m=0,1,2,3,4$, etc. Not all of these 15 integers have nonzero hundredths digits, however. For $n\\leq 10$, it is possible that the tenths digit is nonzero while the hundredths digit is zero. Checking the values of $n$ up to 10, we find that the hundredths digits of 1, 1/2, 1/5, and 1/10 are zero. Therefore, there are $15 - 4 = \\boxed{11}$ fractions that yield terminating decimals with a nonzero digit two places to the right of the decimal point.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for a decimal to be terminating?\n2. In this problem, what is the condition for a fraction $\\frac{1}{n}$ to have a terminating decimal with a non-zero hundredths digit?\n3. How can we determine if a fraction has a terminating decimal or not?\n4. Why is it sufficient to check if the prime factorization of $n$ only contains 2 and 5?\n5. How can we generate a list of numbers with prime factorizations containing only twos and fives?\n6. How can we determine the number of integers in this list that have a non-zero hundredths digit?\n7. Why do we need to check the values of $n$ up to 10 separately?\n8. Can you explain the significance of the subtraction $15 - 4$ in the final answer?"
