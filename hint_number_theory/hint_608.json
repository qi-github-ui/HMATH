    "problem": "Find the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We can use the distributive property of multiplication to multiply a three-digit palindrome $aba$ (where $a$ and $b$ are digits) with 101: $$ 101 \\cdot aba = (100 + 1) \\cdot aba = aba00 + aba = ab(2a)ba. $$Here, the digits of the product are $a$, $b$, $2a$, $b$, and $a$, unless carrying occurs.  In fact, this product is a palindrome unless carrying occurs, and that could only happen when $2a \\ge 10$.  Since we want the smallest such palindrome in which carrying occurs, we want the smallest possible value of $a$ such that $2a \\ge 10$ and the smallest possible value of $b$.  This gives us $\\boxed{505}$ as our answer and we see that $101 \\cdot 505 = 51005$ is not a palindrome.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is a palindrome and how is it related to this problem?\n2. Can you explain the process of multiplying a three-digit palindrome by 101 using the distributive property?\n3. Why does carrying occur in the product of the multiplication?\n4. How can we find the smallest value of $a$ such that $2a \\ge 10$?\n5. What is the significance of finding the smallest possible value of $b$?\n6. Can you explain why the product of the smallest three-digit palindrome with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome?\n7. Are there any other scenarios where carrying might occur in this calculation?\n8. How does this problem showcase the concept of the distributive property in Number Theory?\n9. Are there any other interesting patterns or properties you notice in this problem?"
