    "problem": "The number 210 is the product of two consecutive positive integers and is also the product of three consecutive integers. What is the sum of those five integers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "First we prime factorize $210=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7$. Trying some pairwise products of these primes, we see that $210=(2\\cdot7)(3\\cdot5)=14\\cdot15$. Also, $210=(5)(2\\cdot3)(7)=5\\cdot6\\cdot7$. The sum of the five integers is $14+15+5+6+7=\\boxed{47}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we prime factorize the number 210?\n2. What are the possible combinations of two consecutive positive integers that multiply to give 210?\n3. What are the possible combinations of three consecutive positive integers that multiply to give 210?\n4. How can we determine the sum of these five integers?\n5. Can you explain why 210 can be written as both $(2\\cdot7)(3\\cdot5)$ and $(5)(2\\cdot3)(7)$?\n6. How did you determine that $14\\cdot15$ and $5\\cdot6\\cdot7$ are the combinations that satisfy the given conditions?\n7. Can you think of any other numbers that can be expressed as the product of consecutive positive integers? If yes, how would you find the sum of those integers?"
