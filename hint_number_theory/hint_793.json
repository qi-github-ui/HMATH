    "solution": "From the second given congruence, we have $$c\\equiv 3\\cdot 5c\\equiv 3\\cdot 2\\equiv 6\\pmod 7.$$From the third given congruence, we have $$5b\\equiv 3\\pmod 7$$$$\\implies b\\equiv 3\\cdot 5b\\equiv 3\\cdot 3\\equiv 2\\pmod 7.$$Then, from the first given congruence, we have $$1\\equiv abc a\\cdot 6\\cdot 2\\equiv 12a\\equiv 5a\\pmod 7$$$$\\implies a\\equiv 3\\cdot 5a\\equiv 3\\cdot 1\\equiv 3\\pmod 7.$$Thus, $$a+b+c\\equiv 3+2+6\\equiv \\boxed{4}\\pmod 7.$$",

Why is it important to find the remainders of a, b, and c when divided by 7 in this problem?\n6. If the given congruences had different moduli, how would that affect the solution approach?\n7. Can you think of other similar problems that involve solving a system of congruences?\n8. How does the concept of remainders help in solving modular equations?"
