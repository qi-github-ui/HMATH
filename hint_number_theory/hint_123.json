    "problem": "What is the base-10 integer 515 when expressed in base 6?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The largest power of 6 less than 515 is $6^3=216$, and the largest multiple of 216 less than 515 is $2\\cdot216=432$. That means there is a 2 in the $6^3$ place. We have $515-432=83$ left. The largest multiple of a power of 6 that is less than 83 is $2\\cdot6^2=72$. There is a 2 in the $6^2$ place. Now we're left with $83-72=11$, which can be represented as $1\\cdot6^1+5\\cdot6^0$. So, we get $515=2\\cdot6^3+2\\cdot6^2+1\\cdot6^1+5\\cdot6^0=\\boxed{2215_6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How do you know that the largest power of 6 less than 515 is $6^3=216$?\n2. How does knowing the largest power of 6 less than 515 help you determine the digit in the $6^3$ place of the base-6 representation of 515?\n3. After determining the digit in the $6^3$ place, how do you find the remaining digits of the base-6 representation of 515?\n4. Is there only one way to convert a base-10 integer to a base-6 integer? If not, what are some different methods that could be used?\n5. How does the process of converting a base-10 integer to a base-6 integer relate to the concept of place value in our number system?\n6. Can you think of other situations in which converting between different bases might be useful or necessary in solving a problem?"
