    "problem": "The base six number $53_{6}$ is equal to the base $b$ number $113_{b}$. What is the positive value of $b$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "First, we have $$53_6=5\\cdot6^1+3\\cdot6^0=33_{10}.$$ and  $$113_b=1\\cdot b^2+1\\cdot b^1+3\\cdot b^0=(b^2+b+3)_{10}.$$ Therefore, we must have $b^2+b+3=33$, so $b^2+b-30=0$. Factoring we have $(b-5)(b+6)=0$. Thus, $b=5$ or $b=-6$. The positive value is $b=\\boxed{5}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you write out the base six number $53_6$ in base ten?\n2. What is the representation of the base $b$ number $113_b$ in base ten?\n3. What equation can we set up using the above information?\n4. How can we solve for $b$ in the equation?\n5. Can we have multiple values of $b$ that satisfy the equation? How can we determine which is the positive value?\n6. Can you think of any other problem that involves converting numbers between different bases? How would you approach solving it using similar steps?"
