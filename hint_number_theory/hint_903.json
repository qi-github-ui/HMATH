    "problem": "A standard six-sided die is rolled, and  $P$ is the product of the five numbers that are visible. What is the largest number that is certain to divide $P$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since $6! = 720 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, the prime factors of $P$ can consist of at most 2's, 3's, and 5's.  The least possible number of 2's is two, which occurs when 4 is not visible. The least possible number of 3's is one, which occurs when either 3 or 6 is not visible, and the least number of 5's is zero, when 5 is not visible.  Thus $P$ must be divisible by $2^2\\cdot3 =\n\\boxed{12}$, but not necessarily by any larger number.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the problem in your own words? \n2. What are the possible prime factors that can divide the product P? \n3. What is the minimum possible number of 2's that can divide the product P? \n4. What is the minimum possible number of 3's that can divide the product P? \n5. What is the minimum possible number of 5's that can divide the product P? \n6. What is the largest number that is certain to divide the product P based on the given information?"
