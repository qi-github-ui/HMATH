    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then $n^2$ has exactly $3$ digits in base 9 if and only if $$9^2\\le n^2<9^3.$$Taking square roots, we have $$3^2\\le n<3^3.$$We are looking for $N$, the ${\\bf largest}$ integer $n$ satisfying the above constraints. So, $$N=3^3-1=3\\cdot 9-1 =2\\cdot 9+8.$$Written in base $9$, this is $\\boxed{28}$ or $\\boxed{28_9}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the concept of base 9 and how it differs from base 10?\n2. How can we determine the number of digits in a base 9 representation of a given number?\n3. What are the constraints for $n^2$ to have exactly 3 digits in base 9?\n4. How does taking the square root of both sides of the inequality help us find $N$?\n5. Can you explain why we need to find the largest integer $n$ that satisfies the constraints?\n6. What is the value of $N$ in base 9 after solving the inequality?"
