    "problem": "The least common multiple of two numbers is 3780, and the greatest common divisor is 18. Given that one of the numbers is 180, what is the other number?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We use the identity $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  We are told that $\\gcd(a,b) = 18$, and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 3780$, so $ab = 18 \\cdot 3780$.  If one number is 180, then the other number is $18 \\cdot 3780/180 = \\boxed{378}$.",
