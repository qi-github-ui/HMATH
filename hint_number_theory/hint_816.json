    "problem": "Express $249_{11}+3AB_{12}$ as a base 10 integer. Here $A$ and $B$ denote the digits whose values are 10 and 11, respectively, in base 12.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We have that \\begin{align*} 249_{11} &= 2(11^2)+ 4(11^1) +9(11^0) \\\\\n&= 2(121)+4(11)+9(1)\\\\\n&= 242 + 44 + 9\\\\\n&= 295\\\\\n3AB_{12} &= 3(12^2)+ 10(12^1) +11(12^0) \\\\\n&= 3(144)+10(12)+11(1)\\\\\n&= 432 + 120 + 11\\\\\n&= 563\n\\end{align*}So, $249_{11}+3AB_{12}=295+563=\\boxed{858}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given expression and what do the digits A and B represent in base 12?\n2. Could you explain step-by-step how you converted the number \"249\" from base 11 to base 10?\n3. How did you calculate the value of the number \"3AB\" in base 12 and convert it to base 10? \n4. Can you demonstrate how you added the two converted numbers together to get the final result?\n5. Is there any significance or special properties in the numbers \"249\" and \"3AB\" that may affect the final result?\n6. What would happen if we changed the base of the numbers in this expression? How would that affect the answer?"
