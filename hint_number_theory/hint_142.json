    "problem": "What is the first digit (from left to right) of the base $8$ representation of $473_{10}$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The largest power of $8$ that is still less than $473$ is $8^2 = 64$ and the largest multiple of $64$ that is less than $473$ is $7 \\cdot 64 = 448$. Thus, when $473_{10}$ is written in base $8$, its first digit is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the base 8 representation means and how it works?\n2. How can we determine the first digit of a number's base 8 representation?\n3. Are there any patterns or properties of base 8 that could help us find the first digit?\n4. Can you identify the largest power of 8 that is still less than $473_{10}$? What is its corresponding multiple?\n5. What is the significance of this largest multiple in finding the first digit?\n6. How can we use this information to determine the first digit of $473_{10}$ in base 8?\n7. Can you think of other numbers and their base representations where a similar approach can be applied to find the first digit?"
