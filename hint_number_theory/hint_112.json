    "problem": "Given that $n$ is a positive integer, and given that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[24,n]=72$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,27]=108$, what is $n$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We know that both $72$ and $108$ are multiples of $n$, so $108-72=36$ is also a multiple of $n$. That is, $n$ is a divisor of $36$.\n\nNote that $24$ is not divisible by $3^2$, but $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[24,n]=72$ is divisible by $3^2$. This implies that $n$ is a multiple of $3^2$.\n\nSimilarly, $27$ is not divisible by $2^2$, but $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,27]=108$ is divisible by $2^2$. This implies that $n$ is a multiple of $2^2$.\n\nThe only divisor of $36$ that is a multiple of $3^2$ and $2^2$ is $36$ itself. Thus, $n=\\boxed{36}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. What are the different methods you know that can be used to solve this type of problem?\n3. If we consider the first given condition, how does the fact that the least common multiple of 24 and n is 72 help us narrow down the possibilities for n?\n4. Why is it significant that the least common multiple of n and 27 is 108? What does this tell us about the possible values of n?\n5. Based on the information we have so far, what can we conclude about the factors of n?\n6. How can we determine the correct value of n by considering the factors and the conditions given?\n7. Can you think of any other types of problems that might involve similar thinking and steps to solve?"
