    "problem": "Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the formula for finding the total number of positive divisors of a given number?\n2. How can we determine the number of positive factors of a prime number?\n3. What are the prime factorizations of numbers in the form of $p^{2}$, where $p$ is a prime number?\n4. Can you explain why $x$, $y$, and $z$ must be in the form of $p^{2}$ in this problem?\n5. How can we calculate the total number of factors for the expression $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ based on these prime factorizations?\n6. Can you think of any other scenarios where a similar approach can be applied to determine the number of factors of an expression?"
