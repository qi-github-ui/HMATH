    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Instead of converting to base 10 and then to base 4, we use the fact that $2^2=4$. We have $11011000_2=1\\cdot2^7+1\\cdot2^6+1\\cdot2^4+1\\cdot2^3$ $=2\\cdot(2^2)^3+1\\cdot(2^2)^3+1\\cdot(2^2)^2+2\\cdot(2^2)^1$ $=3\\cdot4^3+1\\cdot4^2+2\\cdot4^1+0\\cdot4^0=\\boxed{3120_4}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean to represent a number in a different base?\n2. Why would we want to use base 4 instead of base 10 to represent this number?\n3. What is the value of each digit in the base 2 number $11011000_2$?\n4. How can we use the fact that $2^2=4$ to convert the base 2 number to base 4?\n5. How do we express the base 2 number $11011000_2$ in terms of powers of $2^2=4$?\n6. What is the value of each digit in the base 4 representation $3120_4$ we calculated?\n7. How do we know that our calculation is correct and that $3120_4$ is the base 4 representation of $11011000_2$?"
