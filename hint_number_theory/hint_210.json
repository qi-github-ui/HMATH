    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We need to find the smallest integer, $k,$ that has exactly $10$ factors. $10=5\\cdot2=10\\cdot1,$ so $k$ must be in one of two forms:\n\n$\\bullet$ (1) $k=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^1$ for distinct primes $p_1$ and $p_2.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p_1=2$ and $p_2=3,$ which gives $k=2^4\\cdot3=48.$\n\n$\\bullet$ (2) $k=p^9$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^9>48.$\n\nThus, the least positive integer with exactly $10$ factors is $\\boxed{48}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for an integer to have \"exactly 10 positive factors\"? \n2. Are there any restrictions on the value of the integer we are trying to find? \n3. Can you list some examples of integers with fewer than 10 factors? \n4. Can you explain why the two forms given in the problem statement are the only possibilities for an integer with exactly 10 factors? \n5. How did we determine that $48$ is the smallest integer with exactly 10 factors? \n6. Can you think of any other ways to approach this problem, or any related problems that might use similar techniques?"
