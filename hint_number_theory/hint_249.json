    "problem": "A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. What is the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 that can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in a different base?  Give your response in base 2.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The smallest possible 5-digit palindrome in base 2 is $10001_2$, which is $2^4+2^0=17_{10}$. Now we try converting 17 to other bases. In base 3, we get $122_3$, and in base 4, we get $101_4$, which is a palindrome. So $\\boxed{10001_2}$ works.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a palindrome is and why it is relevant to this problem?\n2. How many digits are there in a 5-digit palindrome in base 2?\n3. Can you find the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2? How did you arrive at your answer?\n4. What is the value of the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 when converted to base 10?\n5. How can we convert a number from base 10 to a different base? Can you explain the process?\n6. Can you convert the value of the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 to base 3? What is the result?\n7. How about converting it to base 4? Is it still a palindrome? If not, how would you modify the number to make it a 3-digit palindrome in base 4?\n8. Can you recall any other bases that could potentially result in a 3-digit palindrome when the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 is converted?\n9. How would you determine if a number is a palindrome in a different base?\n10. What is your final answer to the problem, and why?"
