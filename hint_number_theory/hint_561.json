    "problem": "The product of positive integers $x$, $y$ and $z$ equals 2004. What is the minimum possible value of the sum $x + y + z$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Prime factorize $2004=2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 167$.  One of the summands $x$, $y$, or $z$ should be 167, for otherwise the summand which has 167 as a prime factor is at least $2\\cdot 167$.  The other two summands multiply to give 12, and the minimum sum of two positive integers that multiply to give 12 is $4+3=7$.  Therefore, the minimum value of $x+y+z$ is $167+4+3=\\boxed{174}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find?\n2. What is the prime factorization of 2004?\n3. Can you explain why at least one of the summands should be 167?\n4. What are the possible values for the other two summands based on their prime factorization?\n5. What is the minimum sum of two positive integers that multiply to give 12? \n6. What is the minimum possible value of the sum $x + y + z$ based on our findings? \n7. Are there any other ways to approach this problem? If so, what are they?"
