    "solution": "We start from $2^1$ and consider the remainder when successive powers of 2 are divided by 7.  \\begin{align*}\n2^1 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 2}\\\\\n2^2 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 4}\\\\\n2^3 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 1}\\\\\n2^4 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 2}\\\\\n2^5 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 4}\\\\\n2^6 &\\text{ leaves a remainder of 1}\\\\\n&\\hphantom{\\text{ leaves a re}}\\vdots\n\\end{align*} Since 2004 is divisible by 3 (the digits sum to 6, which is a multiple of 3), we find that $2^{2005}$ leaves a remainder of $\\boxed{2}$ when divided by 7.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain why we are starting from $2^1$ and considering the remainder when successive powers of 2 are divided by 7?\n2. What pattern do you notice in the remainders when we divide successive powers of 2 by 7?\n3. How can we use this pattern to determine the remainder when $2^{2005}$ is divided by 7?\n4. What is the significance of the fact that the pattern repeats every 3 powers of 2?\n5. Can you explain why we can use the remainder of $2^3$ (which is 1) to find the remainder of $2^{2005}$?\n6. Based on the pattern we observed, what is the remainder when $2^{2005}$ is divided by 7?"
