    "solution": "When adding the numbers, we notice that $4+4$ leaves a residue of $2$ when divided by $6.$ Thus, the sum will have a rightmost digit of $2,$ and we must carry-over. This yields that $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c} & & & \\stackrel{1}{} & \\stackrel{}{4}_6 \\\\ &+ & & 1 & 4_6 \\\\ \\cline{2-5} && & 2 & 2_6 \\\\ \\end{array}$$ The sum is therefore $\\boxed{22_6}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step in adding two numbers in base 6?\n2. Can you explain why a carry-over is necessary when adding $4_6+14_6$?\n3. How can we check if our computed sum is correct?\n4. Are there any other methods we can use to add numbers in base 6?\n5. Can you generalize the process of adding numbers in different bases?"
