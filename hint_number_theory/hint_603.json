    "problem": "The number of students in Teresa's graduating class is more than 50 and fewer than 100 and is 1 less than a multiple of 3, 2 less than a multiple of 4, and 3 less than a multiple of 5. How many students are in Teresa's graduating class?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let the number of students in Teresa's class be $a$. Then \\begin{align*}\na\\equiv -1\\equiv 2\\pmod 3,\\\\\na\\equiv -2\\equiv 2\\pmod 4,\\\\\na\\equiv -3\\equiv 2\\pmod 5.\n\\end{align*} Since $\\gcd(3,4)=\\gcd(4,5)=\\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $$a\\equiv 2\\pmod{3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5},$$ that is, $a\\equiv 2\\pmod{60}$. Since $a$ is then of the form $a=2+60n$, the only such number in the range $50<a<100$ is $\\boxed{62}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find?\n2. How did we use the given information to set up congruences for $a$?\n3. Why did we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find a congruence for $a$?\n4. How did we use the congruence for $a$ to determine the form of possible solutions?\n5. Why is $a=62$ the only solution in the given range?\n6. If we changed the given range of possible values for $a$, how would the solution change?"
