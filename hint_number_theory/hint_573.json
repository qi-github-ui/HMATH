    "problem": "How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "For a number to leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, it must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. it must divide exactly into $47 - 5$, or 42, and\n\n2. it must be greater than 5, because the divisor is always greater than the remainder.\n\nWe list all divisors of 42 in pairs. They are 1 and 42, 2 and 21, 3 and 14, 6 and 7. Of these, only 42, 21, 14, 6, and 7 are greater than 5. There are $\\boxed{5}$ different counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean for a number to leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?\n2. Can you identify the conditions that a number must satisfy to leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?\n3. How can you determine the divisors of 47 - 5 (or 42)?\n4. Why must the divisor be greater than 5 in this scenario?\n5. Can you list all the divisors of 42 and identify which ones are greater than 5?\n6. How can you count the number of divisors that satisfy both conditions and find the answer to the problem?"
