    "solution": "An integer that is congruent to $15 \\pmod{22}$ is of the form $22n+15$.\n\nTherefore, we make the equation $22n+15<10000$, and find the largest possible $n$. \\begin{align*}\n22n+15&<10000 \\\\\n22n&<9985 \\\\\nn&<\\frac{9985}{22} \\approx 453.85\n\\end{align*}The largest possible integer $n$ is $453$. We plug it in for $n$ to get $22 \\cdot 453 +15 =\\boxed{9981}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you define what it means for two integers to be congruent modulo a certain number?\n2. How can we use this definition to approach the problem of finding the largest $4$ digit integer congruent to $15$ modulo $22$?\n3. What is the largest possible value we can give to $n$ in the equation $22n+15<10000$?\n4. How can we use the value we found for $n$ to determine the largest $4$ digit integer congruent to $15$ modulo $22$?\n5. Can you think of other examples where the concept of congruence modulo a number can be applied? How can we approach those problems using similar methods?"
