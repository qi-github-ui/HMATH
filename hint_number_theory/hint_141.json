    "problem": "A math class has fewer than $40$ students. When the students try to sit in rows of $7$, $3$ students sit in the last row. When the students try to sit in rows of $5$, $1$ student is left in the last row. How many students are in this class?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of students in the class. When we divide $n$ by $7$, we get a remainder of $3$. Therefore, we need to add multiples of $7$ to $3$ until we get a number which, when we divide by $5$, has a remainder of $1$. When we add $28$ to $3$, we get $31$, a number that gives a remainder of $1$ when dividing by $5$. By the Chinese remainder theorem, the other integers which leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 7 and a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 differ from 31 by a multiple of $7\\cdot 5=35$. Therefore, the only integer between 0 and 40 satisfying these conditions is 31, and there are $\\boxed{31}$ students in this math class.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What information is given in the problem about the seating arrangement in the math class?\n2. How can we represent the number of students in the class mathematically? \n3. Why is there a remainder of 3 when the number of students is divided by 7? Can you explain the significance of this remainder?\n4. What does it mean when there is 1 student left in the last row when the number of students is divided by 5? How does this relate to the remainder obtained?\n5. How can we find a number that satisfies both conditions (remainder of 3 when divided by 7 and remainder of 1 when divided by 5)?\n6. Can you explain the reasoning behind adding multiples of 7 to 3 until we obtain a number with a remainder of 1 when divided by 5?\n7. How does the Chinese remainder theorem help us find the other integers that satisfy both conditions?\n8. What is the difference between the number 31 and the other integers that satisfy the conditions? Why is this difference important?\n9. Can you explain how we determine that there is only one integer between 0 and 40 that satisfies the conditions?\n10. What is the final answer to the problem and how did you arrive at this conclusion?"
