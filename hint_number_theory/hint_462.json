    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor. \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(10293,29384) &=\\text{gcd}\\,(29384-2 \\cdot 10293,10293)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(8798,10293)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(8798,10293-8798)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(8798,1495)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(8798-1495 \\cdot 5 ,1495)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(1323,1495)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(1323,1495-1323)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(1323,172)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(1323-172 \\cdot 7 ,172)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(119,172)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(119,172-119)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(119,53)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(119-53 \\cdot 2,53)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(13,53).\\\\\n\\end{align*}At this point we can see that since $53$ is not divisible by the prime number $13$, the greatest common divisor is just $\\boxed{1}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step in finding the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm?\n2. Can you explain why we subtracted multiples of one number from the other in each step?\n3. How do we know when we have found the greatest common divisor?\n4. What other algorithms or methods can be used to find the greatest common divisor?\n5. Are there any patterns or observations you noticed in the steps taken to find the greatest common divisor?\n6. Can you think of a different pair of numbers where the Euclidean algorithm would be useful in finding the greatest common divisor?"
