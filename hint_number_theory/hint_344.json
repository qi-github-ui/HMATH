    "problem": "What is the greatest three-digit multiple of 19?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since 19 is close to 20 and $20\\cdot50=1000$, we consider \\[19\\cdot50=950.\\] From here we skip-count by 19s: \\[950,969,988,1007,\\ldots\\] The largest three-digit multiple of 19 is $\\boxed{988}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a multiple is?\n2. How do you find multiples of a given number?\n3. What is the largest two-digit multiple of 19?\n4. Can you use skip-counting to find the largest three-digit multiple of 19?\n5. What is the relationship between the multiples of 19 and the multiples of 20?\n6. Are there any other methods or tricks you know to find multiples of a given number? How do they compare to the method we used for this problem?"
