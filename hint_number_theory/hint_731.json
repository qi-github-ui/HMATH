    "problem": "Eleanor is making chocolate chip cookies for her friends. If she divides the cookies equally among $11$ of her friends, she'll have $4$ cookies left over. If she divides the cookies equally among $7$ of her friends, she'll have $1$ cookie left over. Assuming that Eleanor made fewer than $100$ cookies, what is the sum of the possible numbers of cookies that she could have made?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If Eleanor made $N$ cookies, we know from the first requirement that $N = 11x + 4$ for some integer $x,$ and from the second requirement we know that $N = 7y+1$ for some integer $y.$ Therefore,  $$11x+4 = 7y+1\\Rightarrow 11x+3 = 7y$$If we list the possible values of $11x+3$ such that $N = 11x+4<100,$ we have $14,$ $25,$ $36,$ $47,$ $58,$ $69,$ $80,$ $91.$ The only members of this list divisible by $7$ are $14$ and $91,$ and so the possible values of $$11x+4 = 7y+1$$are $14+1 = 15$ and $91+1 = 92$, and thus the sum of the possible numbers of cookies is $15+92 =\\boxed{107}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe how Eleanor's cookie count relates to the number of her friends in each scenario?\n2. Are there any patterns or relationships that you notice from the given information?\n3. How can we express the number of cookies Eleanor made using mathematical expressions?\n4. Based on the given conditions, can you write two equations to represent the scenarios?\n5. What values can be substituted into the equations to satisfy both conditions while keeping the number of cookies less than 100?\n6. What are the possible values for the number of cookies Eleanor made in each scenario?\n7. What is the sum of these possible values?"
