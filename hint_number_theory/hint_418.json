    "problem": "Convert $2014_{10}$ to base 9.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We see that the largest power of 9 that is less than 2014 is $9^3=729$, and the largest multiple of 729 less than 2014 is 1458, or $2\\cdot729$. From here, we find that the largest power of nine less than $2014-1458=556$ is $9^2=81$, and the largest multiple of 81 less than 556 is 486, or $6\\cdot81$. Next, the largest power of nine that is less than $556-486=70$ is $9^1=9$, giving us 63 or $7\\cdot 9$ as the largest multiple of 9. Finally, this leaves us with $70-63=7$, or $7\\cdot1=7\\cdot9^0$. Therefore, we can express 2014 as $2\\cdot9^3+6\\cdot9^2+7\\cdot9^1+7\\cdot9^0$, which gives us $\\boxed{2677_9}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the process for converting a base 10 number to a different base, such as base 9?\n2. How do we determine the largest power of 9 that is less than the given number 2014?\n3. What is the significance of finding the largest power of 9 in this conversion process?\n4. How do we use the largest power of 9 to find the next digit in the conversion to base 9?\n5. What is the pattern we are following in this step-by-step conversion process?\n6. How do we know when we have finished converting the base 10 number to base 9? \n7. Can this same conversion process be applied to converting a base 10 number to any other base? If so, how? \n8. How would we check our answer to make sure it is correct?"
