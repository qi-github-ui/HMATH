    "problem": "What is the least positive integer with exactly five distinct positive factors?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Recall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $5$ factors. Since 5 is prime, the only way for a positive integer to have 5 factors is for the only exponent in its prime factorization to be 4.  The smallest fourth power of a prime number is $2^4=\\boxed{16}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the key concept we need to understand in order to determine the number of factors of a positive integer?\n2. Can you explain the method of determining the number of factors using prime factorization?\n3. Why do we add 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization to find the number of factors?\n4. How does working backwards from the desired number of factors help us find the smallest positive integer?\n5. Why is the exponent in the prime factorization of the smallest positive integer with 5 factors equal to 4?\n6. Why is 5 the only prime number that leads to a positive integer with exactly 5 factors?\n7. How did we determine that $2^4$ is the smallest fourth power of a prime number?\n8. Can you explain why $2^4$ is indeed the correct answer and how it satisfies the conditions of having exactly five distinct positive factors?\n9. Can you think of any other scenario where working backwards from the desired number of factors could be useful?\n10. Are there any other concepts or scenarios in number theory where prime factorization and the count of factors play a significant role?"
