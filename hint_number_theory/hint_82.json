    "problem": "What is the smallest two-digit integer $n$ such that switching its digits and then adding 3 results in $2n$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $10a+b$ represent $n$, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively. Switching the digits and adding 3 results in $10b+a+3$, which we set equal to $2n$. \\begin{align*}\n2(10a+b)&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n20a+2b&=10b+a+3\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n19a&=8b+3\n\\end{align*}For the smallest $n$, we let the tens digit $a=1$. We have $19=8b+3$, which means $b=2$. So the smallest $n$ is $\\boxed{12}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find? Can you rephrase it in your own words?\n2. How can we represent a two-digit integer using variables? What variables can we use and what do they represent?\n3. How can we switch the digits of a two-digit integer and add 3 to it? Can we express this using algebraic expressions?\n4. By setting up an equation using the given conditions, how can we represent the relationship between the original number and the switched digits' sum?\n5. Can we simplify the equation? Are there any common factors or terms that can be canceled out?\n6. How can we determine the smallest possible value for the original number? What values can we choose for the tens and units digits?\n7. By substituting the chosen values into the equation, can we find a solution? Is there any trial and error involved?\n8. Does the solution match the given conditions? How can we verify that the chosen number satisfies the requirements?\n9. Are there any other types of problems that may involve similar thinking and steps to solve?"
