    "problem": "Convert $1357_{10}$ to base 5.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We see that the largest power of 5 that is less than 1357 is $5^4=625$, and the largest multiple of 625 less than 1357 is 1250, or $2\\cdot625$. From here, we find that the largest power of five less than $1357-1250=107$ is $5^2=25$, and the largest multiple of 25 less than 107 is 100, or $4\\cdot25$. Next, the largest power of five that is less than $107-100=7$ is $5^1=5$, simply giving us 5 or $1\\cdot 5$ as the largest multiple of 5. Finally, this leaves us with $7-5=2$, or $2\\cdot1=2\\cdot5^0$. Therefore, we can express 1357 as $2\\cdot5^4+0\\cdot5^3+4\\cdot5^2+1\\cdot5^1+2\\cdot5^0$, which gives us $\\boxed{20412_5}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the concept of base conversion and how does it relate to our everyday understanding of number systems?\n2. How do we determine the largest power of the new base that is less than the given number and what is its significance in the conversion process?\n3. How do we find the largest multiple of the power of the new base found in step 2 that is less than the given number and what does it represent in the final converted form?\n4. Can you explain the reasoning behind choosing the next largest power of the new base in step 3 and repeating the process until we have converted the entire given number?\n5. How do we then express the given number as a sum of multiples of powers of the new base to obtain the final converted form, and what should be the order of these multiples based on the positioning of the powers in the original base? \n6. Can you think of any other number systems besides base 10 and 5, and how would the process of conversion differ to convert a number from base 10 to one of these other systems?"
