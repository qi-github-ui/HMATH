    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We have $\\gcd(n,100) = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]-450$. Since $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]$ is a multiple of $100$, we infer that $\\gcd(n,100)$ is a multiple of $50$ but not of $100$. But $\\gcd(n,100)$ is also a divisor of $100$, so it can only be $50$.\n\nThis implies two conclusions: first, $n$ is a multiple of $50$ (but not of $100$); second, $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100] = \\gcd(n,100)+450 = 50+450 = 500.$$In particular, $n$ is less than $500$, so we need only check the possibilities $n=50,150,250,350,450$. Of these, only $250$ satisfies our second conclusion, so $n=250$ is the unique solution -- and the sum of all solutions is thus $\\boxed{250}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the given equation in your own words? What does it mean for the least common multiple of two numbers to be equal to their greatest common divisor plus 450?\n2. If we let $n$ be a positive integer, what can we say about the possible values of the greatest common divisor of $n$ and 100? What about the possible values of the least common multiple of $n$ and 100?\n3. If we let $\\gcd(n,100) = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]-450$, what does that tell us about the value of $\\gcd(n,100)$?\n4. What can we conclude about the possible values of $n$ based on the properties of the greatest common divisor and least common multiple?\n5. Based on the above conclusions, what can we say about the value of $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]$? What does that tell us about the value of $n$?\n6. Can you find any positive integers less than 500 that satisfy the equation? If so, what are those values and how did you verify that they are correct?\n7. Is there any other type of equation where similar reasoning and steps might be useful? Can you think of any examples?"
