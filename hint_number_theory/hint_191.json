Are there any different methods you can think of for this particular congruence?\n3. If you choose to reduce the factors modulo 20, how would you go about finding the appropriate reductions? \n4. Why is it possible to reduce the factors modulo 20 in this congruence? Are there any characteristics that make it suitable for this method?\n5. What are the reduced values of the factors? How do these values verify that your solution is correct?\n6. Can you think of other types of congruences that might require similar thinking and steps in solving?\n7. What is the value of n in the congruence $77\\cdot 88\\cdot 99 \\equiv n\\pmod{20}$?"
