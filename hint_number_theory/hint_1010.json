    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and the largest perfect cube less than 399 is $7^3=343$.  Any perfect fourth power is already a square, so we may skip to the largest fifth power less than $399$, which is $3^5=243$, Again, a sixth power is a square (and a cube), so we look to the largest seventh power less than $399$, which is $2^7 = 128.$ Eighth, ninth and tenth powers may be skipped again because they would already have been included as perfect squares or cubes, and there is no eleventh power less than $399$ other than $1$.  Thus the largest perfect power less than 399 is $19^2=361$, and $a+b=19+2=\\boxed{21}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. When finding the value of $a^b$ that is less than 399, what is the first value of $a$ that we should consider?\n2. For each value of $a$, what values of $b$ should we consider to find the largest possible $a^b$ less than 399?\n3. What is the largest perfect square less than 399? How does it help us determine the largest value of $a$?\n4. Are there any perfect cubes or higher powers that fall within the range we are looking at? How can we identify them?\n5. Can you explain why we can skip checking for fourth powers and higher in this problem?\n6. What is the largest value of $a$ for which there is no perfect power less than 399? How does it help us answer the question?\n7. Finally, what is the sum of the largest $a$ and its corresponding value of $b$?"
