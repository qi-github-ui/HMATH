    "problem": "In 2010, the sum of the year's digits is $3$.  What is the first year after 2010 in which the sum of the digits is 3 again?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The year 3000 has a digit-sum of 3, so we look for possibilities before then. If the first digit is 2, then the remaining digits must be 0, 0, and 1. So the three years between 2000 and 3000 with a digit-sum of 3 are 2001, 2010, and 2100. Of these, only $\\boxed{2100}$ is in the future.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you define the sum of the digits of a year?\n2. What information is provided in the problem statement regarding the sum of the digits?\n3. Can you determine the sum of the digits for the year 2010? If so, please explain how.\n4. In order to find the first year after 2010 with a digit sum of 3, what range of years should we consider? Can you provide a specific upper limit?\n5. If we consider the range of years before the year 3000, what possibilities exist for the first digit of the year that would result in a digit sum of 3? List them.\n6. Among the possibilities identified in the previous question, which years have a digit sum of 3 and are in the future? Please list them.\n7. Out of the years mentioned in the previous question, which is the first year after 2010? Explain your reasoning.\n8. Can you think of any other number or year-related problems where similar thinking and steps may be applicable?"
