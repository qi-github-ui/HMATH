    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of $z$, respectively.  Then $\\bar{z}=a-bi$, so that $-3i\\bar{z}=-3b-3ia$.  We now find that \\[ 2z-3i\\bar{z} = 2a+2ib -3b - 3ia = (2a-3b) + (2b-3a)i. \\]So if $2z-3i\\bar{z}=-7+3i$ then (by matching real and imaginary components) we must have $2a-3b=-7$ and $-3a+2b=3$.  This system of equations is routine to solve, leading to the values $a=1$ and $b=3$.  Therefore the complex number we are seeking is $z=\\boxed{1+3i}$.",

How can we express $\\bar{z}$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts?\n4. What is the equation that results from substituting $z=a+bi$ and $\\bar{z}=a-bi$ into the original equation?\n5. How can we use the equation found in question 4 to solve for the values of $a$ and $b$?\n6. Once we have determined the values of $a$ and $b$, how can we express the complex number $z$ in terms of them?\n7. How can we check that our solution is valid and satisfies the original equation?\n8. Can you think of any other equations that can be solved using a similar approach of expressing complex numbers in terms of their real and imaginary parts?"
