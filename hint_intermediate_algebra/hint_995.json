How can we use the value $f(30) = 20$ to find the value of $f(40)$? \n4. If we substitute $x=30$ and $y= \\frac{4}{3}$ into the functional equation, what do we get? \n5. How can we simplify $\\frac{f(30)}{4/3}$ to find the value of $f(40)$?\n6. Can you think of any other similar functional equations or problems that involve a similar approach or logic that could help us solve for $f(40)$?"
