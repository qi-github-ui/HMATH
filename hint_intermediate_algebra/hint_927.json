Then we have the equations \\[\\begin{aligned} C &= 1, \\\\ A+B+C &= 12, \\\\ 4A+2B+C &= 123. \\end{aligned} \\]Substituting $C=1$ into the second and third equations gives $A+B=11$ and $4A+2B=122.$ Then $2A+B=61,$ so $A = (2A+B)-(A+B) = 61-11=50.$ Then $B=11-A=-39,$ and so \\[f(3) = 9A+3B+C=9(50)+3(-39)+1= \\boxed{334}.\\]",
