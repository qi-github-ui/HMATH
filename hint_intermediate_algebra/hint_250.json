    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. What can you tell me about the lines $4x - 3y = 30$ and $4x - 3y = -10$? How does this information help us find the center of the circle?\n3. Since the center of the circle lies on the line $2x + y = 0$, can you find the coordinates of the center by solving a system of equations? If so, what are the values of $x$ and $y$ for the center?\n4. How did you determine that the center of the circle lies exactly halfway between the parallel lines $4x - 3y = 30$ and $4x - 3y = -10$?\n5. What is the significance of the line $4x - 3y = 10$ in relation to the center of the circle?\n6. Suppose the lines $4x - 3y = 30$ and $4x - 3y = -10$ were not parallel. How could we find the center of the circle in this case? Can you generalize the process for finding the center of a circle tangent to two non-parallel lines?"
