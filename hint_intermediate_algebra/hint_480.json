    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "From the equation $a^3 + b^3 = a + b,$\n\\[(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = a + b.\\]Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $a + b$ is positive, so we can cancel the factors of $a + b$ to get\n\\[a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{a^2 + b^2 - 1}{ab} = \\frac{ab}{ab} = \\boxed{1}.\\]",

What can we do to connect the expression $\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{a}-\\frac{1}{ab}$ to the given equation $a^3 + b^3 = a + b$?\n3. Can we write $\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{a}-\\frac{1}{ab}$ in terms of $a^3+b^3$ and $a+b$?\n4. How can we express $a^2-ab+b^2$ in terms of $a$ and $b$, and how does this help us simplify the expression $\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{a}-\\frac{1}{ab}$?\n5. What is the relationship between $\\frac{a^2+b^2-1}{ab}$ and the simplified expression of $\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{a}-\\frac{1}{ab}$?\n6. Can you think of other ways to approach this problem that would lead to the same simplified expression?"
