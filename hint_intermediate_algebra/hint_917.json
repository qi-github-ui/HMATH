    "problem": "Find the number of ordered pairs of integers $(a,b)$ with $1 \\leq a \\leq 100$ and $b \\geq 0$ such that the polynomial $x^2+ax+b$ can be factored into the product of two (not necessarily distinct) linear factors with integer coefficients.",

    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Because the given quadratic has leading coefficient $1$, both factors must be of the form $x-c$ (or $-x+c$). Therefore, such a factorization exists if and only if $x^2 + ax + b$ has two integer roots. Letting $r$ and $s$ denote these roots, we have, by Vieta's formulas, \\[\\begin{aligned} r+s &= -a, \\\\ rs &= b. \\end{aligned}\\]Since $r+s = -a$ is negative but $rs = b$ is nonnegative, it follows that both $r$ and $s$ must be negative or zero. Now, for each $a$, there are $a+1$ possible pairs $(r, s)$, which are $(0, -a)$, $(-1, -a+1)$, $\\ldots$, $(-a, 0)$. However, since the order of $r$ and $s$ does not matter, we only get $\\lceil \\tfrac{a+1}{2} \\rceil$ distinct polynomials $x^2+ax+b$ for each possible value of $a$. It follows that the number of these polynomials is \\[\\sum_{a=1}^{100} \\left\\lceil \\frac{a+1}{2} \\right\\rceil = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + \\dots + 50 + 50 + 51 = \\boxed{2600}\\]since if we pair up the terms in this sum end-to-end, each pair has a sum of $52 = 2 \\cdot 26$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean for a quadratic polynomial to be factored into the product of two linear factors?\n2. Can you explain why the leading coefficient of the quadratic polynomial must be 1 for this factorization to be possible?\n3. What are Vieta's formulas, and how are they relevant to this problem?\n4. How do we use Vieta's formulas to express the sum and product of the roots of the quadratic polynomial in terms of its coefficients?\n5. Given that both roots of the quadratic polynomial are negative or zero, how does that help us determine the possible values for the pair of roots?\n6. Keeping in mind that the order of the roots does not matter, how many distinct polynomials can be obtained for a given value of $a$?\n7. Can you explain why the number of these polynomials can be expressed as the sum of rounded up values for each possible value of $a$?\n8. Can you calculate the final answer using the provided formula and explain your steps?"
