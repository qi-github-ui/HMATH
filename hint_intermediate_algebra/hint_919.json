    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you summarize the given problem in your own words?\n2. What is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and how is it used in this problem?\n3. When do we have equality in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality?\n4. Based on the equality condition, what can we say about the values of $1 - x_1,$ $x_1 - x_2,$ and so on?\n5. Let $d = 1 - x_1.$ What is the value of $d,$ and how does it relate to the given condition? \n6. Using the value of $d,$ can you determine the values of $x_1,$ $x_2,$ and so on? \n7. Is there more than one solution to the given equation? If not, why not?\n8. Can you apply similar techniques to solve other problems involving Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and inequalities in general?"
