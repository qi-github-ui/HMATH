    "solution": "By Vieta's formulas, \\[t = -(a+b)(b+c)(c+a).\\]From the first cubic polynomial, we have $a+b+c=-3$. Using this equation, we can rewrite the expression for $t$ as \\[t = -(-3-c)(-3-a)(-3-b).\\]To compute this expression quickly, notice that, for any $x$, \\[x^3 + 3x^2 + 4x - 11 = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)\\]by the factor theorem. Setting $x = -3$, we get \\[(-3)^3 + 3(-3)^2 + 4(-3) - 11 = -23 = (-3-a)(-3-b)(-3-c).\\]Thus, $t = -(-23) = \\boxed{23}$.",
