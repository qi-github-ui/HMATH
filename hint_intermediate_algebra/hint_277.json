    "solution": "Let $S = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \\dotsb.$  Then\n\\[xS = x + 2x^2 + 3x^3 + \\dotsb.\\]Subtracting these equations, we get\n\\[(1 - x) S = 1 + x + x^2 + \\dotsb = \\frac{1}{1 - x},\\]so $S = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}.$  Thus, we want to solve\n\\[\\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}  = 9.\\]then $(1 - x)^2 = \\frac{1}{9},$ so $1 - x = \\pm \\frac{1}{3}.$  Since $x$ must be less than 1, $1 - x = \\frac{1}{3},$ so $x = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the equation we are trying to solve?\n2. Can you expand out the expression for $S$?\n3. How did we get the equation $(1 - x)S = \\frac{1}{1-x}$?\n4. Why did we subtract the two equations $(1 - x)S$ and $xS$ from each other?\n5. What is the resulting expression after we subtract the two equations from each other?\n6. How did we simplify the expression $\\frac{1}{1-x} = 9$ to $(1-x)^2 = \\frac{1}{9}$?\n7. Why do we consider only the positive solution for $1-x$?\n8. What is the final value of $x$ that we obtained after solving the equation?"
