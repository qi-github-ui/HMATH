    "solution": "Let $r$ and $s$ be the two common roots.  Then $r$ and $s$ are the roots of\n\\[(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - (x^3 + bx^2 + 14 + 8) = (a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2.\\]Note that $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of\n\\begin{align*}\n&4(x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6) - 3(x^3 + bx^2 + 14x + 8) \\\\\n&= x^3 + (4a - 3b) x^2 + 2x \\\\\n&= x[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2].\n\\end{align*}Since the constant coefficient of $x^3 + ax^2 + 11x + 6$ is nonzero, both $r$ and $s$ are non-zero.  Therefore, $r$ and $s$ are the roots of\n\\[x^2 + (4a - 3b) x + 2.\\]Hence, both $r$ and $s$ are the roots of $-x^2 + (3b - 4a) x - 2.$  But $r$ and $s$ are also the roots of $(a - b) x^2 - 3x - 2,$ so the coefficients must match.  This gives us $a - b = -1$ and $3b - 4a = -3.$  Solving, we find $(a,b) = \\boxed{(6,7)}.$\n\nFor these values, the given cubics become\n\\begin{align*}\nx^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 &= (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3), \\\\\nx^3 + 7x^2 + 14x + 8 &= (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 4).\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you restate the problem in your own words? What are we trying to find in this question?\n2. If the cubic polynomials have two distinct roots in common, what does that imply about those common roots? Can you write an equation using those roots?\n3. From the given equations, how can we isolate the term related to $x^2$? What are the coefficients in front of $x^2$ in each equation?\n4. Since the common roots satisfy both equations, what equation can we set up that includes the product of the common roots? How can we use that equation to solve for $a-b$?\n5. If $a-b=-1$, what does that tell us about the coefficients in front of $x^2$? Can we use this information to set up another equation involving $a$ and $b$?\n6. How can we solve the system of equations $a-b=-1$ and $3b-4a=-3$ to find the values of $a$ and $b$?\n7. What are the values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the system of equations, and therefore, give us the ordered pair $(a,b)$ of real numbers?"
