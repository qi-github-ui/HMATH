    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We can write the equation of the hyperbola as\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{144/25} - \\frac{y^2}{81/25} = 1,\\]so for the hyperbola, $a = \\frac{12}{5}$ and $b = \\frac{9}{5}.$  Then\n\\[c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{144}{25} + \\frac{81}{25}} = 3.\\]Thus, the foci are at $(\\pm 3,0).$\n\nThen for the ellipse, $a^2 = 16,$ so\n\\[b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 16 - 9 = \\boxed{7}.\\]",
