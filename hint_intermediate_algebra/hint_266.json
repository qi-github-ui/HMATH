    "solution": "Since $0 < x < 1,$\n\\[x^2 < x < 2x,\\]and $x^2 < x < \\sqrt{x}$ and $x < 1 < \\frac{1}{x}.$  Therefore, the smallest number is always $x^2,$ and the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{B}}.$",

Are you able to determine the smallest value by looking at the options?\n4. What is the relationship between the different expressions ($x$, $x^2$, $2x$, $\\sqrt{x}$, and $\\frac{1}{x}$) when $0 < x < 1$? \n5. How can you compare the values of $x$, $x^2$, $2x$, $\\sqrt{x}$, and $\\frac{1}{x}$ to determine which is the smallest?\n6. Can you explain why $x^2$ is always the smallest value in this case?\n7. Can you think of any similar problems or scenarios where you might use similar reasoning and steps?"
