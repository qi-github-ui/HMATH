Given that $f(10) = 14$ and $f(40) = 20,$ how can we use this information to find $f(500)$?\n4. How can we use $f(xy) = f(x) + f(y)$ to solve for $f(2)$ and $f(5)$?\n5. What system of equations can we form with the information we found in question 4, and how can we solve it to find $f(2)$ and $f(5)$?\n6. Using the values we found in question 5, how can we compute $f(500)$ using the given formula for $f$?\n7. Can you think of other functions that satisfy the property $f(xy) = f(x) + f(y)$? What properties would they have? How can we solve for their values given some initial conditions?"
