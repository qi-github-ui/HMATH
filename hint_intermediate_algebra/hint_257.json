    "problem": "The graph of \\[y^4 - 4x^4 = 2y^2 - 1\\]is the union of the graphs of two different conic sections. Which two types of conic sections are they?\n\n(Write your answer as a list, with \"C\" for circle, \"E\" for ellipse, \"H\" for hyperbola, and \"P\" for parabola. For example, \"C, H\" if you think the graph consists of a circle and a hyperbola. You may use a letter twice.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We can rewrite the given equation as \\[y^4 - 2y^2 + 1 = 4x^4.\\]The left-hand side is the perfect square of a binomial: \\[(y^2-1)^2 = 4x^4.\\]Therefore, either $y^2-1=2x^2$ or $y^2-1=-2x^2.$ That is, either $y^2-2x^2=1$ or $y^2+2x^2=1.$ These are the equations for a hyperbola and an ellipse, respectively, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{H, E}}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you rewrite the given equation in a form that makes it easier to identify the conic sections in the graph?\n2. What is the left-hand side of the rewritten equation, and what is it equal to?\n3. How can you use the left-hand side of the equation to find the equations of the conic sections in the graph?\n4. What are the equations of the conic sections in the graph?\n5. Are these conic sections the same or different, and how can you tell?\n6. Which type of conic section is represented by the equation $y^2-2x^2=1$, and what are its defining characteristics?\n7. Which type of conic section is represented by the equation $y^2+2x^2=1$, and what are its defining characteristics?\n8. How do these two conic sections combine to form the graph of the given equation?\n9. Can you think of other equations that might represent graphs that are unions of different conic sections? If so, what are they and how can you identify the type(s) of conic sections involved?"
