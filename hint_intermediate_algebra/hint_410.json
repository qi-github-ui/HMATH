    "solution": "From $x + 4y = 4,$ $y = -\\frac{x}{4} + 1.$  Hence, the $x_i$ are the roots of\n\\[x^3 - 3x + 2 = -\\frac{x}{4} + 1.\\]Then by Vieta's formulas, $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0,$ and\n\\[y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = -\\frac{x_1}{4} + 1 - \\frac{x_2}{4} + 1 - \\frac{x_3}{4} + 1 = -\\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3}{4}+3 = 3.\\]Hence, $(A,B) = \\boxed{(0,3)}.$",
