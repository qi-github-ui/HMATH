    "problem": "How many positive integers $n$ satisfy \\[(n + 8)(n - 3)(n-12)<0\\]",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "If $n$ is less than $3$, then $n+8$ is positive, $n-3$ is negative, and $n-12$ is negative.  Therefore, the product on the left-hand side of the inequality is positive, so the inequality is not satisfied.  If $n$ is strictly between 3 and 12, then $n+8$ is positive, $n-3$ is positive, and $n-12$ is negative.  In this case, the product on the left-hand side is negative, so the inequality is satisfied.  If $n$ is greater than 12, then $n+8$ is positive, $n-3$ is positive, and $n-12$ is positive.  Again, the product is positive so the inequality is not satisfied.  If $n=3$ or $n=12$, then the left-hand side is 0, so the inequality is not satisfied.  Therefore, the only solutions of the inequality are the $12-3-1=\\boxed{8}$ integers strictly between 3 and 12.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the conditions under which the expression $(n + 8)(n - 3)(n-12)$ would be less than zero (negative)?\n2. What are the possible sign combinations for the factors $(n + 8)$, $(n - 3)$, and $(n-12)$ that would result in a negative product? \n3. If $n$ is less than $3$, what would be the signs of $(n + 8)$, $(n - 3)$, and $(n-12)$? What would be the effect on their product?\n4. If $n$ is strictly between $3$ and $12$, what would be the signs of $(n + 8)$, $(n - 3)$, and $(n-12)$? What would be the effect on their product?\n5. If $n$ is greater than $12$, what would be the signs of $(n + 8)$, $(n - 3)$, and $(n-12)$? What would be the effect on their product?\n6. How many possible integer solutions can we have between $3$ and $12$ inclusive?"
