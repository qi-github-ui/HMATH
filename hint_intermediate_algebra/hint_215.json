Also, $p(x)$ has degree at most 9.  Therefore, by the Identity Theorem, $p(x) = 512$ for all $x.$  In particular, $p(10) = \\boxed{512}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the set $S$ represents in this problem?\n2. How would you define the polynomial $p_s(x)$ for a given 10-tuple $s$ in $S$?\n3. Can you provide an example of a specific 10-tuple $s$ and calculate the corresponding polynomial $p_s(x)$?\n4. What is the relationship between the polynomial $p(x)$ and the set $S$?\n5. How can we calculate the value of $p(n)$ for any given $n$, where $0 \\leq n \\leq 9$?\n6. By substituting $x=10$ into the polynomial $p(x)$, what value do we obtain?\n7. How can we justify that $p(x) = 512$ for all values of $x$?\n8. Are there any other properties or characteristics of the polynomial $p(x)$ that we should consider while solving this problem?"
