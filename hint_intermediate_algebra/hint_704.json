    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the first step in solving this equation?\n2. Why did we use partial fractions to rewrite the left-hand side of the equation?\n3. How did we determine that we needed to multiply both sides by $6(x - 4)(x - 1)$?\n4. Can you show the detailed steps for simplifying the equation $(x - 1) - (x - 4) = \\frac{1}{6}(x - 4)(x - 1)$?\n5. How did we arrive at the quadratic equation $x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0$ from the simplified equation?\n6. Why did we factor the quadratic equation to find the solutions instead of using another method?\n7. How did we determine that the solutions to $(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0$ are $x = 7$ and $x = -2$?\n8. Can you provide a step-by-step explanation of how to check that these solutions satisfy the original equation?"
