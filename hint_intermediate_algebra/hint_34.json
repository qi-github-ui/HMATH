How is it related to the partial sums of the sequence?\n3. Given the Cesaro sum of a 99-term sequence is 1000, what equation can we set up using the definition of Cesaro sum?\n4. How can we express the Cesaro sum of the 99-term sequence in terms of its individual terms $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{99}$?\n5. How can we use the equation from the previous question to solve for the value of $99a_1 + 98a_2 + \\dots + 2a_{98} + a_{99}$?\n6. If we want to find the Cesaro sum of the 100-term sequence $(1, a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{99})$, how can we modify the equation from question 3?\n7. What is the Cesaro sum of the 100-term sequence $(1, a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{99})$ given that the Cesaro sum of the 99-term sequence is 1000?"
