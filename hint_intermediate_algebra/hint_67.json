    "problem": "Let $x$ and $y$ be real numbers such that $3x + 2y \\le 7$ and $2x + 4y \\le 8.$  Find the largest possible value of $x + y.$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Dividing the second inequality by 2, we get $x + 2y \\le 4.$  Adding the first inequality $3x + 2y \\le 7,$ we get\n\\[4x + 4y \\le 11,\\]so $x + y \\le \\frac{11}{4}.$\n\nEquality occurs when $x = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $y = \\frac{5}{4},$ so the largest possible value of $x + y$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{4}}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the given inequalities and what they represent in the context of this problem?\n2. How can we find the largest possible value of $x+y$ in this scenario?\n3. Can you explain the reasoning behind dividing one of the inequalities by 2 and adding the other inequality?\n4. How does this process help us to better understand and manipulate the given inequalities?\n5. Can you think of any other scenarios where a similar approach could be used to find the maximum or minimum value of a given function subject to certain constraints?"
