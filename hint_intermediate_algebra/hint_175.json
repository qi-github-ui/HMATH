    "problem": "Find the quadratic polynomial, with real coefficients, which has $3 + i$ as a root, and where the coefficient of $x^2$ is 2.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the polynomial has real coefficients, the other root must be $3 - i.$  Thus, the polynomial is\n\\begin{align*}\n2(x - 3 - i)(x - 3 + i) &= 2((x - 3)^2 - i^2) \\\\\n&= 2((x - 3)^2 + 1) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{2x^2 - 12x + 20}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the first step should be in finding the quadratic polynomial?\n2. How do you determine the other root of the polynomial if one root is given?\n3. Why does the polynomial have the form $(x - 3 - i)(x - 3 + i)$?\n4. How did you simplify the expression $((x - 3)^2 - i^2)$?\n5. What is the significance of the term $(x - 3)^2$ in the polynomial?\n6. Are there any other methods you can think of to find the quadratic polynomial?"
