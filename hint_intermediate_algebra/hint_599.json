    "solution": "Let $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.$  Then from the given information,\n\\begin{align*}\n4a - 2b + c &= 13, \\\\\na + b + c &= -2, \\\\\n9a + 3b + c &= 8.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting the first and second equations, and second and third equations, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n-3a + 3b &= -15, \\\\\n8a + 2b &= 10.\n\\end{align*}Then $-a + b = -5$ and $4a + b = 5.$  We can quickly solve, to find $a = 2$ and $b = -3.$  Substituting into the equation $a + b + c = -2,$ we get $2 - 3 + c = -2,$ so $c = -1.$  Therefore, $p(x) = \\boxed{2x^2 - 3x - 1}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information in the problem and what is asked to find? \n2. How can we use the given information to form equations for the coefficients of the quadratic polynomial? \n3. Can you explain why we subtract the equations in step two to eliminate the variable $c$? \n4. What is the significance of the equations obtained in step three and how do they help us to solve for the coefficients? \n5. How did we use the equations from step four to solve for the coefficients $a$ and $b$? \n6. Does the value obtained for $c$ in step six make sense? Why or why not? \n7. Can you check that the quadratic polynomial $p(x)$ obtained in the end indeed satisfies the given conditions? \n8. How can we generalize this method to find a quadratic polynomial given three arbitrary points?"
