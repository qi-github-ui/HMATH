    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the goal of this problem? What do we want to find? \n2. How can we start solving this problem? What approach should we take? \n3. Why do we multiply both sides by $(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 5)$? What does this allow us to do? \n4. After multiplying both sides, what do we get? Can you simplify the equation? \n5. What values can we substitute for $x$ to help us find the constants $A,$ $B,$ and $C$? \n6. Let's set $x = 2.$ What does that tell us about the constant $A$? \n7. Let's set $x = 3.$ What can we determine about the constant $B$? \n8. Let's set $x = 5.$ What does that tell us about the constant $C$? \n9. Based on the values we found for $A,$ $B,$ and $C,$ what is the ordered triple $(A,B,C)$? \n10. Can you explain the significance of this ordered triple in the original equation?"
