    "solution": "Setting $x = 4,$ we get\n\\[3f(4) - 2 f \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 4.\\]Setting $x = \\frac{1}{4},$ we get\n\\[3 f \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right) - 2f(4) = \\frac{1}{4}.\\]We can view these equations as a system in $f(4)$ and $f \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right).$  Solving this system, we find $f(4) = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}.$",
