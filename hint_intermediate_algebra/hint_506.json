    "problem": "In a certain sequence the first term is $a_1=2007$ and the second term is $a_2=2008$.  Furthermore, the values of the remaining terms are chosen so that $a_n+a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}=n$ for all $n\\ge 1$.  Determine $a_{1000}$.",

    "solution": "To get started, we compute the first ten terms as: \\[ 2007, 2008, -4014, 2008, 2009, -4013, 2009, 2010, -4012, 2010, \\ldots \\]It appears that each term is 1 greater than the number three terms previous.  We can demonstrate that this will always occur using the given recurrence relation.  We know that $a_n+a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}=n$ and that $a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}+a_{n+3}=n+1$.  Subtracting the former from the latter yields $a_{n+3}-a_n=1$, which is the pattern that we observed.  Therefore we find that \\[ a_1 = 2007, \\ a_4=2008, \\ a_7=2009, \\ldots, a_{1000}=2007+333=\\boxed{\\mathbf{2340}}. \\]",

Based on the given recurrence relation, what can we infer about the relationship between consecutive terms in the sequence?\n4. How can we use the pattern observed in the terms to find the value of $a_{1000}$?\n5. Can you describe the steps you would take to find $a_{1000}$ based on the given information? \n6. Can you think of any other sequences or recurrence relations that could be similar to this problem? How might we approach solving those as well?"
