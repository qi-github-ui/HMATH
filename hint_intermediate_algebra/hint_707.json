    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying both sides by $x-4,$ we get $x(x-4) + 45 = -10(x-4),$ or $x^2-4x+45 = -10x+40,$ which simplifies to $x^2+6x + 5 = 0.$ This quadratic factors as $(x+1)(x+5) = 0,$ so either $x=-1$ or $x=-5,$ both of which we can check are valid solutions. Therefore, the answer is \\[x = \\boxed{-1, \\; -5}.\\]",

If you choose to multiply both sides by $(x-4),$ what are the possibilities you need to consider for the value of $x$?\n4. Why is it possible to factor the quadratic equation $x^2+6x + 5 = 0$? What characteristics make it suitable for factoring?\n5. What are the factors you found? How can you verify that these factors give us the correct solutions?\n6. Can you think of other types of equations where a similar approach might be used to find solutions?"
