    "solution": "Let $\\alpha$ be a root of $x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = 0,$ so\n\\[\\alpha^4 + \\alpha^3 + \\alpha^2 + \\alpha + 1 = 0.\\]Then $(\\alpha - 1)(\\alpha^4 + \\alpha^3 + \\alpha^2 + \\alpha + 1) = 0,$ which simplifies to $\\alpha^5 = 1.$  Then\n\\begin{align*}\n\\alpha^{44} + \\alpha^{33} + \\alpha^{22} + \\alpha^{11} + 1 &= (\\alpha^5)^8 \\cdot \\alpha^4 + (\\alpha^5)^6 \\cdot \\alpha^3 + (\\alpha^5)^4 \\cdot \\alpha^2 + (\\alpha^5)^2 \\cdot \\alpha + 1 \\\\\n&= \\alpha^4 + \\alpha^3 + \\alpha^2 + \\alpha + 1 \\\\\n&= 0.\n\\end{align*}Since the first polynomial is 0 for every root $\\alpha$ of the second polynomial, the first polynomial is divisible by the second polynomial, which means the remainder is $\\boxed{0}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the polynomial we want to find the remainder of, and what is the polynomial we want to divide by?\n2. What is the relationship between the roots of the second polynomial and the value of $\\alpha$ in the first polynomial?\n3. How can we use the relationship between the roots of the second polynomial and $\\alpha$ to simplify the expression we are trying to find the remainder of?\n4. Could we have used synthetic division or long division instead of the method presented in the given solution? How do these methods work?\n5. If the remainder was not equal to zero, what would that tell us about the roots of the second polynomial?"
