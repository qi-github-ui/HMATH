    "solution": "First, we can multiply the factors $x + 5$ and $x + 12$ to get\n\\[(x + 5)(x + 12) = x^2 + 17x + 60.\\]We can then multiply the factors $x + 6$ and $x + 10$ to get\n\\[(x + 6)(x + 10) = x^2 + 16x + 60.\\]So, let $u = x^2 + 16x + 60.$  Then\n\\begin{align*}\n4(x + 5)(x + 6)(x + 10)(x + 12) - 3x^2 &= 4(u + x)(u) - 3x^2 \\\\\n&= 4u^2 + 4ux - 3x^2 \\\\\n&= (2u + 3x)(2u - x) \\\\\n&= (2(x^2 + 16x + 60) + 3x)(2(x^2 + 16x + 60) - x) \\\\\n&= (2x^2 + 35x + 120)(2x^2 + 31x + 120) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{(2x^2 + 35x + 120)(x + 8)(2x + 15)}.\n\\end{align*}",

If we consider the expression $x^2 + 16x + 60$, how can we factor it further? \n4. Why is factoring $(x^2 + 17x + 60)$ and $(x^2 + 16x + 60)$ useful in factoring the original expression? \n5. What factors did you obtain for $(x^2 + 17x + 60)$ and $(x^2 + 16x + 60)$, and how can you use them to verify your final answer? \n6. Can you think of any other types of polynomials that might require similar thinking and steps to factor?"
