    "solution": "Because $(x-4)^2$ is always nonnegative, we can safety multiply both sides of the inequality by $(x-4)^2$ without changing the direction of the inequality, with the caveat that we cannot have $x = 4$: \\[\\begin{aligned} x(x+1) &\\ge 12(x-4)^2 \\\\ 0 &\\ge 11x^2 - 97x + 192. \\end{aligned}\\]This quadratic factors as \\[0 \\ge (x-3)(11x-64),\\]which holds if and only if $3 \\le x \\le \\frac{64}{11}.$ However, since $x \\neq 4,$ the solutions to the original inequality are given by \\[x \\in \\boxed{[3, 4) \\cup \\left(4, \\frac{64}{11}\\right]}\\,.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we start solving the inequality $\\frac{x(x+1)}{(x-4)^2} \\ge 12$? What should be our first step?\n2. What are some different methods we can use to solve this type of inequality?\n3. If we choose to multiply both sides of the inequality by $(x-4)^2$, what do we need to consider?\n4. Why can we safely multiply both sides by $(x-4)^2$ in this case? What makes it appropriate to use this method?\n5. We have obtained a quadratic equation after multiplying both sides. How can we factorize it to find the solutions?\n6. What are the factors we found, and how can we use them to verify our solutions?\n7. Can you think of other types of equations where similar reasoning and steps might be required?"
