    "problem": "Rectangle $ABCD$ has area $2006.$ An ellipse with area $2006\\pi$ passes through $A$ and $C$ and has foci at $B$ and $D$. What is the perimeter of the rectangle?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $2a$ and $2b$ be the lengths of the major and minor axes of the ellipse, respectively, and let the dimensions of the rectangle be $x$ and $y.$ Then $x+y$ is the sum of the distances from the foci to point $A$ on the ellipse, which is $2a,$ so $x+y=2a.$ Also, the length of a diagonal of the rectangle is $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2},$ which is also equal to the distance between the foci of the ellipse, which is $2\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}.$ Thus, $x^2+y^2 = 4(a^2-b^2).$ Then the area of the rectangle is \\[\n2006=xy=r\\frac{1}{2}\\displaystyle\\left[(x+y)^2-(x^2+y^2)\\displaystyle\\right]=r\\frac{1}{2}\\displaystyle\\left[(2a)^2-(4a^2-4b^2)\\displaystyle\\right]=2b^2,\n\\]so $b=\\sqrt{1003}.$ Thus, the area of the ellipse is \\[\n2006\\pi=\\pi ab=\\pi a\\sqrt{1003}.\n\\]Thus, $a=2\\sqrt{1003},$ and the perimeter of the rectangle is $2(x+y)=4a=\\boxed{8\\sqrt{1003}}.$\n[asy]\nsize(7cm);\n\nreal l=9,\nw=7,\nang=asin(w/sqrt(l*l+w*w))*180/pi;\ndraw((-l,-w)--(l,-w)--(l,w)--(-l,w)--cycle);\ndraw(rotate(ang)*ellipse((0,0),2*l+2*w,l*w*2/sqrt(l^2+w^2)));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-l,w),NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(-l,-w),SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(l,-w),SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(l,w),NE);\n// Made by chezbgone2\n[/asy]",
