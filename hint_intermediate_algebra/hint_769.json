    "solution": "Let the base triangles have sides $a$ and $b$ with included angle $\\theta,$ and let the right prism have altitude $h$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F;\n\nA = (0,0);\nB = (3,-1);\nC = (-1,-2);\nD = A + (0,-4);\nE = B + (0,-4);\nF = C + (0,-4);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(E--F);\ndraw(F--D--E,dashed);\ndraw(A--D,dashed);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\n\nlabel(\"$a$\", (B + C)/2, S);\nlabel(\"$b$\", (A + C)/2, NW);\nlabel(\"$h$\", (C + F)/2, W);\nlabel(\"$\\theta$\", C + (0.4,0.4));\n[/asy]\n\nThen the surface area constraint is\n\n$$ah + bh + \\frac12 ab \\sin \\theta = 24,$$and the volume is\n\n$$V = \\frac12 abh \\sin \\theta.$$Let $X = ah, Y = bh, Z = (ab \\sin \\theta) / 2$ be the areas of the three faces.  Then $X + Y + Z = 24$, and\n\\[XYZ = \\frac{1}{2} a^2 b^2 h^2 \\sin \\theta = \\frac{2}{\\sin \\theta} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} abh \\sin \\theta \\right)^2 = \\frac{2V^2}{\\sin \\theta}.\\]Now the AM-GM inequality yields\n\n$$(XYZ)^{1/3} \\leq \\frac{X+Y+Z}{3} = 8,$$so $XYZ \\le 512$.  But\n\\[\\frac{2V^2}{\\sin \\theta} = XYZ \\le 512,\\]so\n\\[V^2 \\le 256 \\sin \\theta \\le 256,\\]which means $V \\le 16$.\n\nEquality occurs for $a = b = 4$, $h = 2$, and $\\theta = \\pi/2$, so the maximum volume of the prism is $\\boxed{16}$.",
