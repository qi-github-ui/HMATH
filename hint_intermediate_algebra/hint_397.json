    "problem": "In the year 2001, the United States will host the International Mathematical Olympiad. Let $I$, $M$, and $O$ be distinct positive integers such that the product $I\\cdot M\\cdot O=2001$. What is the largest possible value of the sum $I+M+O$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Factor 2001 into primes to get $2001=3\\cdot 23\\cdot 29$. The largest possible sum of three distinct factors whose product is the one which combines the two largest prime factors, namely $I=23\\cdot\n29=667$, $M=3$, and $O=1$, so the largest possible sum is $1+3+667=\\boxed{671}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given problem asking us to find? \n2. What are the possible values of $I$, $M$, and $O$ that satisfy the given constraints? \n3. What is the prime factorization of the number 2001? \n4. How can we use the prime factorization of 2001 to find the possible values of $I$, $M$, and $O$? \n5. How do we determine the largest possible sum of $I$, $M$, and $O$? \n6. Why did we choose the two largest prime factors of 2001 to come up with the values of $I$, $M$, and $O$? \n7. Is there more than one combination of $I$, $M$, and $O$ that results in the same product of 2001? \n8. How can we check that our answer of 671 is the largest possible sum of three distinct factors whose product is 2001?"
