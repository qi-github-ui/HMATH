    "problem": "Find all real values of $x$ that satisfy $\\frac{x^2+x^3-2x^4}{x+x^2-2x^3} \\ge -1.$ (Give your answer in interval notation.)",

    "solution": "We notice that the numerator and denominator share common factors: $x^2+x^3-2x^4 = x^2(1+x-2x^2)$ and $x+x^2-2x^3=x(1+x-2x^2).$ Hence, whenever $x(1+x-2x^2) \\neq 0,$ we can write \\[\\frac{x^2+x^3-2x^4}{x+x^2-2x^3} = \\frac{x^2(1+x-2x^2)}{x(1+x-2x^2)} = x.\\]It follows that the given inequality is satisfied if and only if $x \\ge -1$ and $x(1+x-2x^2) \\neq 0.$ The roots of $1+x-2x^2$ are $x=1$ and $x=-\\frac12,$ so we cannot have $x=0,$ $x=1,$ or $x=-\\tfrac12.$ Putting all this together, the solution set of the inequality consists of the interval $[-1, \\infty)$ with three \"holes\": \\[x \\in \\boxed{[-1, -\\tfrac12) \\cup (-\\tfrac12, 0) \\cup (0, 1) \\cup (1, \\infty)}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you simplify the expression $\\frac{x^2+x^3-2x^4}{x+x^2-2x^3}$? What common factors do you notice in the numerator and denominator?\n2. What does the inequality $a \\ge -1$ mean? In this case, what does it tell us about the value of $\\frac{x^2+x^3-2x^4}{x+x^2-2x^3}$?\n3. Under what condition(s) is the expression $x(1+x-2x^2)$ not equal to zero? How does this condition relate to the original inequality?\n4. Based on the common factors you found earlier, can you rewrite $\\frac{x^2+x^3-2x^4}{x+x^2-2x^3}$ in a simplified form involving only $x$?\n5. Given the simplification, what values of $x$ satisfy the condition $x \\ge -1$? How can we combine this condition with the condition $x(1+x-2x^2) \\neq 0$?\n6. What are the roots of the quadratic expression $1+x-2x^2$? How do these roots affect our solution set?\n7. Based on the above considerations, can you express the solution set of the inequality $\\frac{x^2+x^3-2x^4}{x+x^2-2x^3} \\ge -1$ in interval notation?"
