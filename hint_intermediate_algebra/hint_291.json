    "solution": "Let $a = f(0)$ and $b = f(f(0))$.  Setting $y = x$ in the given equation, we get\n\\[[f(x)]^2 - x^2 = b \\quad (1)\\]for all $x$.  In particular, for $x = 0$, $a^2 = b$.\n\nSetting $y = 0$ in the given equation, we get\n\\[f(f(x)) = (a - 1) f(x) + a \\quad (2)\\]for all $x$.\n\nSubstituting $f(x)$ for $x$ in equation (1), we get\n\\[[f(f(x))]^2 - [f(x)]^2 = b.\\]But from equation (2), $[f(f(x))]^2 = [(a - 1) f(x) + a]^2 = (a^2 - 2a + 1) [f(x)]^2 + 2a(a - 1) f(x) + a^2$, so\n\\[(a^2 - 2a) [f(x)]^2 + 2a(a - 1) f(x) = af(x) [(a - 2) f(x) + 2(a - 1)] = 0\\]for all $x$.\n\nIf $a \\neq 0$, then\n\\[f(x) [(a - 2) f(x) + 2(a - 1)] = 0\\]for all $x$, so $f(x)$ attains at most two different values.  But by equation (1), this cannot be the case.\n\nHence, $a = 0$, then $b = 0$, so from equation (1),\n\\[[f(x)]^2 = x^2,\\]which means $f(x) = x$ or $f(x) = -x$ for all $x$.\n\nLet $x$ be a value such that $f(x) = x$.  Then $f(f(x)) = f(x) = x$, so by equation (2), $x = -x$, or $x = 0$.  Hence, the only value of $x$ such that $f(x) = x$ is $x = 0$.  Therefore, $f(x) = -x$ for all $x$.  It is easy to check that this solution works.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of $f(1)$ is $\\boxed{-1}.$",
