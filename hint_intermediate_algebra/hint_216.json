    "solution": "Note that $x = 0$ is not a solution.  Also, if $x < 0,$ then the left-hand side is positive and the right-hand side is negative, so $x$ cannot be a solution.  Thus, any real roots must be positive.  Assume $x > 0.$\n\nDividing both sides by $x^{2005},$ we get\n\\[\\frac{(x^{2006} + 1)(x^{2004} + x^{2002} + x^{2000} + \\dots + x^2 + 1)}{x^{2005}} = 2006.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{x^{2006} + 1}{x^{1003}} \\cdot \\frac{x^{2004} + x^{2002} + x^{2000} + \\dots + x^2 + 1}{x^{1002}} = 2006,\\]or\n\\[\\left( x^{1003} + \\frac{1}{x^{1003}} \\right) \\left( x^{1002} + x^{1000} + x^{998} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{x^{998}} + \\frac{1}{x^{1000}} + \\frac{1}{x^{1002}} \\right) = 2006.\\]By AM-GM,\n\\begin{align*}\n x^{1003} + \\frac{1}{x^{1003}} &\\ge 2, \\\\\nx^{1002} + x^{1000} + x^{998} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{x^{998}} + \\frac{1}{x^{1000}} + \\frac{1}{x^{1002}} &\\ge \\sqrt[1003]{x^{1002} \\cdot x^{1000} \\cdot x^{998} \\dotsm \\frac{1}{x^{998}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x^{1000}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x^{1002}}} = 1003,\n\\end{align*}so\n\\[\\left( x^{1003} + \\frac{1}{x^{1003}} \\right) \\left( x^{1002} + x^{1000} + x^{998} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{x^{998}} + \\frac{1}{x^{1000}} + \\frac{1}{x^{1002}} \\right) \\ge 2006.\\]Since we have the equality case, the only possible value of $x$ is 1, so there is $\\boxed{1}$ real root.",
