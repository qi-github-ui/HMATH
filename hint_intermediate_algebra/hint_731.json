    "solution": "Multiplying both sides by $(x + 1)^2,$ we get\n\\[(13x - x^2)(x(x + 1) + (13 - x)) = 42(x + 1)^2.\\]This expands to $x^4 - 13x^3 + 55x^2 - 85x + 42 = 0,$ which factors as $(x - 1)(x - 6)(x^2 - 6x + 7) = 0.$  By the quadratic formula, the roots of $x^2 - 6x + 7 = 0$ are $3 \\pm \\sqrt{2}.$  Therefore, the solutions are $\\boxed{1, 6, 3 + \\sqrt{2}, 3 - \\sqrt{2}}.$",
