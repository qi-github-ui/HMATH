    "socratic_questions": "1. What is a rational function?\n2. Can you rewrite the given equation to express $f(x)$ in terms of $f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$?\n3. How can we use the given equation to eliminate $f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)$ and solve for $f(x)$?\n4. How did we get the system of equations that allowed us to solve for $f(-2)$ and $f\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$?\n5. Is there a way we can check if the values we obtained for $f(-2)$ and $f\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ are correct?\n6. If we were given a different rational function and equation, how might we approach solving it?"
