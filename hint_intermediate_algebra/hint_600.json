    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We must have \\[\\lfloor x \\rfloor - \\{x\\} = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor,\\]or, simplifying the right-hand side, \\[\\lfloor x \\rfloor - \\{x\\} = \\{x\\}.\\]Thus, \\[\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2\\{x\\}.\\]Since the left-hand side is an integer, $2\\{x\\}$ must be an integer. We know that $0 \\le \\{x\\} < 1,$ so either $\\{x\\} = 0$ or $\\{x\\} = \\tfrac12.$ If $\\{x\\} = 0,$ then $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2 \\cdot 0 = 0,$ so $x = 0,$ which is impossible because we are given that $x$ is nonzero. So we must have $\\{x\\} = \\tfrac12,$ so $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 2 \\cdot \\tfrac12 = 1,$ and $x = 1 + \\tfrac12 = \\boxed{\\tfrac32}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the problem in your own words?\n2. What is an arithmetic sequence? Can you write down the formula for an arithmetic sequence?\n3. How does the given information $\\{x\\}, \\lfloor x \\rfloor, x$ being in arithmetic sequence help us in solving for $x$?\n4. What is the relationship between $\\{x\\}$ and $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ based on the given information? How can we use this to express $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ in terms of $\\{x\\}$?\n5. Can $\\{x\\}$ be any value? What are the possible values of $\\{x\\}$ based on the given information?\n6. What are the possible values of $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ based on the possible values of $\\{x\\}$?\n7. Can you use the relationship we found earlier to determine the value of $x$?\n8. How do we know that the value we obtained for $x$ is indeed a solution to the given problem?"
