    "problem": "Assume that $f$ and $g$ are functions for which $f^{-1}(g(x))=5x+3$.  Find $g^{-1}(f(-7))$.",

    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that $f^{-1}(u)=v$ is the same as $u=f(v)$.  Therefore $f^{-1}(g(x))=5x+3$ is the same as  \\[g(x)=f(5x+3).\\]We can also use that $g(s)=t$ is equivalent to $s=g^{-1}(t)$ to say \\[x=g^{-1}(f(5x+3)).\\]This gives an expression containing $g^{-1}\\circ f$.\n\nNow we solve: \\[g^{-1}(f(-7))=g^{-1}(f(5(-2)+3)).\\]If $x=-2$ the equation $g^{-1}(f(5x+3))=x$ tells us  \\[g^{-1}(f(5(-2)+3))=\\boxed{-2}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the expression $f^{-1}(g(x))=5x+3$ means in terms of functions? \n2. How can we rewrite the equation $f^{-1}(g(x))=5x+3$ to isolate the function $g$?  \n3. How does the equation $x=g^{-1}(f(5x+3))$ relate to the original equation $f^{-1}(g(x))=5x+3$?  \n4. Based on the expression $x=g^{-1}(f(5x+3))$, what is the value of $x$ when $f(-7)$ is used as the input for $f(5x+3)$?  \n5. According to our calculation, what is the solution for $g^{-1}(f(-7))$?  "
