    "solution": "We are asked to find the integers whose cubes are between $-50$ and $50$.  Since $f(x)=x^3$ is a monotonically increasing function, we can find the least and the greatest integers satisfying the inequality and count the integers between them, inclusive (see graph).  Since $3^3=27<50$ and $4^3=64>50$, $n=3$ is the largest solution.  Similarly, $n=-3$ is the smallest solution.  Therefore, there are $3-(-3)+1=\\boxed{7}$ solutions.

    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the problem is asking us to find?\n2. How can we determine the values of n whose cubes are between -50 and 50?\n3. How can we use the fact that the function f(x) = x^3 is monotonically increasing to help us solve this problem?\n4. What is the least integer value of n whose cube is greater than -50?\n5. What is the greatest integer value of n whose cube is less than 50?\n6. How can we use the least and greatest integer values to determine the number of integer solutions between them?\n7. Can you explain why we add 1 to the difference between the least and greatest solutions?\n8. Is there a faster or more efficient way to solve this problem?"
