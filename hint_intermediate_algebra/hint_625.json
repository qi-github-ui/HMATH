    "solution": "Setting $x = 2,$ we get\n\\[f(2) + f \\left( -\\frac{3}{5} \\right) = 2.\\]Setting $x = -\\frac{3}{5},$ we get\n\\[f \\left( -\\frac{3}{5} \\right) + f \\left( \\frac{1}{7} \\right) = -\\frac{3}{5}.\\]Setting $x = \\frac{1}{7},$ we get\n\\[f \\left( \\frac{1}{7} \\right) + f(2) = \\frac{1}{7}.\\]Adding the first and third equations, we get\n\\[2f(2) + f \\left( -\\frac{3}{5} \\right) + f \\left( \\frac{1}{7} \\right) = \\frac{15}{7}.\\]Then $2f(2) - \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{15}{7},$ which means $2f(2) = \\frac{96}{35},$ so $f(2) = \\boxed{\\frac{48}{35}}.$",
