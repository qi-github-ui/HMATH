    "solution": "Adding $4$ to both sides, we have\n\\[\\left(1+\\dfrac{3}{x-3}\\right) + \\left(1+\\dfrac{5}{x-5}\\right) +\\left(1+ \\dfrac{17}{x-17} \\right)+ \\left(1+\\dfrac{19}{x-19}\\right) = x^2 - 11x \\]or \\[\\frac{x}{x-3} + \\frac{x}{x-5} + \\frac{x}{x-17}+ \\frac{x}{x-19} = x^2-11x.\\]Either $x=0$, or \\[\\frac{1}{x-3} + \\frac{1}{x-5} + \\frac{1}{x-17} + \\frac{1}{x-19} = x-11.\\]To induce some symmetry, we calculate that the average of the numbers $x-3, x-5, x-17, x-19$ is $x-11$. Then, letting $t = x-11$, we have \\[\\frac{1}{t+8} + \\frac{1}{t+6} + \\frac{1}{t-6} + \\frac{1}{t-8} = t,\\]or, combining the first and last terms and the second and third terms, \\[\\frac{2t}{t^2-64} + \\frac{2t}{t^2-36} = t.\\]Either $t=0$, or we can divide by $t$ and cross-multiply, giving \\[2(t^2-36) + 2(t^2-64) = (t^2-36)(t^2-64) \\implies 0 = t^4 - 104t^2 + 2504.\\]Completing the square, we get $(t^2-52)^2 = 200$, so $t^2 = 52 \\pm \\sqrt{200}$, and $t = \\pm \\sqrt{52 \\pm \\sqrt{200}}$. Undoing the substitution $t = x-11$, we have \\[x = 11 \\pm \\sqrt{52 \\pm \\sqrt{200}}.\\]Therefore, the largest root is $x = 11+\\sqrt{52+\\sqrt{200}}$ (which is larger than both $x=0$ and $t=0 \\implies x=11$), and the answer is $11 + 52 + 200 = \\boxed{263}$.",
