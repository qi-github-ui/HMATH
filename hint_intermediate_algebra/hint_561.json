    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we approach the problem of finding integers $n$ that satisfy $10 < n^2 < 99$?\n2. Can we simplify the inequalities $10 < n^2 < 99$ in any way?\n3. How many integers satisfy the inequality $n^2 < 99$? What about $n^2 > 10$?\n4. What is the range of values for $n$ that satisfy the inequality $n^2 < 99$? What about $n^2 > 10$?\n5. How can we find the intersection of the ranges of $n$ that satisfy $n^2 < 99$ and $n^2 > 10$?\n6. What are the integer solutions of $n$ that satisfy the inequality $10 < n^2 < 99$?"
