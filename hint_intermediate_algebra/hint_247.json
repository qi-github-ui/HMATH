    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step in solving this inequality?\n2. What does it mean when we have an absolute value inequality?\n3. How can we split the given inequality into two separate inequalities?\n4. For the first inequality, what values of x make the expression $\\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1}$ greater than 2?\n5. For the second inequality, what values of x make the expression $\\frac{2x - 1}{x - 1}$ less than -2?\n6. Why do we have different solutions for each inequality?\n7. What values of x satisfy both inequalities simultaneously?\n8. Can you graphically represent the solution set on a number line?\n9. Are there any restrictions or numbers that should be excluded from the solution set?\n10. Can you think of any other inequalities that might require similar steps and considerations to solve?"
