Why did we use the QM-AM inequality in this problem? What properties or characteristics make it useful in this context?\n4. What does the equality case of the QM-AM inequality tell us about the values of $x_1, x_2,$ and $x_3$?\n5. How can we use the given conditions $0\\le x_3 \\le x_2 \\le x_1 \\le 1$ to determine the value of $x_1$?\n6. Can you think of any other problems or situations where the QM-AM inequality or a similar thought process might be useful?"
