    "problem": "Let $a, b, c$ be complex numbers, with $a$ real, such that \\[a+b+c=ab+bc+ca=abc=3.\\]Find $a$.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By Vieta's formulas, $a, b, c$ are the roots of the polynomial \\[x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 3 = 0.\\]Adding $2$ to both sides, we can factor this equation as \\[(x-1)^3 = 2.\\]For the real value $x = a$, we have $a - 1 = \\sqrt[3]{2}$, so $a = \\boxed{1 + \\sqrt[3]{2}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are Vieta's formulas and how are they used to find the roots of a polynomial?\n2. In the given equation, what is the relationship between the coefficients $a,b,$ and $c$, and the roots of the polynomial?\n3. How can we use the fact that $a+b+c=3$ to simplify the equation and find restrictions on the possible values of $a$, $b$, and $c$?\n4. How can we use the fact that $abc=3$ to find a relationship between $a$, $b$, and $c$?\n5. How is the equation $x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 3 = 0$ related to the given equation? \n6. What does it mean for $a$ to be real in the context of this problem? \n7. How can we use the factorization $(x-1)^3 = 2$ to find a value of $a$? \n8. Can you think of a similar problem where Vieta's formulas and algebraic manipulations are used to find a specific value of a variable?"
