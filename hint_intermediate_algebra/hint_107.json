Therefore, the lefthand side is greater than $2+2+2-3=3$. Since it is an integer, the smallest value it can be is therefore $\\boxed{4}$. This is in fact attainable by letting $(a,b,c)=(6,8,9)$.",

Can we simplify the expression before finding the minimum value? If so, how?\n4. How does the inequality involving the floor function help us in finding the minimum value?\n5. How does the AM-GM inequality come into play in the solution?\n6. Can we find examples of other problems where using the AM-GM inequality could be helpful in finding a minimum or maximum value?\n7. Why is the minimum value of 4 attainable by setting $(a,b,c)=(6,8,9)$?"
