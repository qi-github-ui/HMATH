    "solution": "An example of a quadratic function with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ is $(x-2)(x-4)$. However, when $x=3$, this function takes the value $-1$. However, multiplying the entire quadratic by $-6$ does not change the location of the zeroes, and does give us the desired value at $x=3$.\n\nThus, $-6(x-2)(x-4)$ has all the desired properties. The expanded form of this expression is $\\boxed{-6x^2+36x-48}$.\n\nNote that this is the only such quadratic. Any quadratic must factor as $a(x-r)(x-s)$, where its zeroes are $r$ and $s$; thus a quadratic with zeroes at $x=2$ and $x=4$ must be of the form $a(x-2)(x-4)$, and the coefficient $a=-6$ is forced by the value at $x=3$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the given problem in your own words? What is it asking for and what information is given?\n2. How would you start approaching this problem? What are some possible steps or strategies you can think of?\n3. What does it mean for a quadratic function to have zeroes at specific values of $x$? How does that relate to the fact that the function takes a particular value when $x=3$?\n4. Why did we choose to represent the quadratic function in the factored form $(x-2)(x-4)$? Are there any other ways we could have represented it?\n5. Why did we multiply the entire expression by $-6$? How does that affect the location of the zeroes and the value at $x=3$?\n6. Is there any other quadratic function that satisfies all the given conditions? How can we be sure that the expression $-6x^2+36x-48$ is the correct answer?"
