From the equality condition for Cauchy-Schwarz,\n\\[\\frac{12 - x}{x} = \\frac{x^2}{12 - x^2}.\\]Then $(12 - x)(12 - x^2) = x^3,$ which simplifies to $x^2 + x - 12 = 0.$  This factors as $(x - 3)(x + 4) = 0,$ so the only solution is $x = \\boxed{3}.$",

Can you explain why the two inequalities we derived from Cauchy-Schwarz must be equal to each other?\n6. How did you use the equality condition in Cauchy-Schwarz to find the expression for $x$?\n7. Can you think of any other inequalities or equations that are similar in nature and could be solved using similar techniques?"
