    "solution": "Setting $n = 0,$ we get\n\\[f(m) + f(-1) = f(m) f(0) + 2.\\]If $f(0) \\neq 1,$ then $f(m)$ is equal to some constant, say $c.$  Then\n\\[2c = c^2 + 2,\\]which has no integer solutions.  Therefore, $f(0) = 1,$ and then $f(-1) = 2.$\n\nSetting $n = 1,$ we get\n\\[f(m + 1) + f(m - 1) = f(1) f(m) + 2.\\]Let $a = f(1)$; then\n\\[f(m + 1) = af(m) - f(m - 1) + 2.\\]Since $f(0) = 1$ and $f(1) = a,$\n\\begin{align*}\nf(2) &= af(1) - f(0) + 2 = a^2 + 1, \\\\\nf(3) &= af(2) - f(1) + 2 = a^3 + 2, \\\\\nf(4) &= af(3) - f(2) + 2 = a^4 - a^2 + 2a + 1, \\\\\nf(5) &= af(4) - f(3) + 2 = a^5 - 2a^3 + 2a^2 + a.\n\\end{align*}Setting $m = n = 2,$ we get\n\\[f(4) + f(3) = f(2)^2 + 2.\\]Then $(a^4 - a^2 + 2a + 1) + (a^3 + 2) = (a^2 + 1)^2 + 2,$ which simplifies to\n\\[a^3 - 3a^2 + 2a = 0.\\]This factors as $a(a - 1)(a - 2) = 0.$  Hence, $a \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}.$\n\nSetting $m = 2$ and $n = 3,$ we get\n\\[f(5) + f(5) = f(2) f(3) + 2.\\]Then $2(a^5 - 2a^3 + 2a^2 + a) = (a^2 + 1)(a^3 + 2) + 2.$  Checking $a = 0,$ $a = 1,$ and $a = 2,$ we find that the only value that works is $a = 2.$\n\nHence,\n\\[f(m + 1) = 2f(m) - f(m - 1) + 2.\\]The first few values are\n\\begin{align*}\nf(2) &= 2f(1) - f(0) + 2 = 5, \\\\\nf(3) &= 2f(2) - f(1) + 2 = 10, \\\\\nf(4) &= 2f(3) - f(2) + 2 = 17,\n\\end{align*}and so on.  By a straight-forward induction argument,\n\\[f(n) = n^2 + 1\\]for all integers $n.$\n\nWe can check that this function works.  Therefore, $n = 1$ and $s = 5,$ so $n \\times s = \\boxed{5}.$",
