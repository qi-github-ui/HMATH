    "solution": "Subtracting $2$ from both sides, we get \\[\\frac{x-1}{x-3} - 2 \\ge 0,\\]or \\[\\frac{x-1 - 2(x-3)}{x-3} = \\frac{-x+5}{x-3} \\ge 0.\\]Negating both sides, we have \\[\\frac{x-5}{x-3} \\le 0.\\]Letting $f(x) = \\frac{x-5}{x-3},$ we make a sign table with the two factors $x-5$ and $x-3$: \\begin{tabular}{c|cc|c} &$x-5$ &$x-3$ &$f(x)$ \\\\ \\hline$x<3$ &$-$&$-$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]$3<x<5$ &$-$&$+$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$x>5$ &$+$&$+$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]\\end{tabular}We see that $f(x) \\le 0$ when $3 < x < 5,$ as well as at the endpoint $x=5.$ Therefore, the solution set is the interval $\\boxed{ (3, 5] }.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the steps in solving the inequality $\\frac{x-1}{x-3} \\ge 2$?\n2. How would you go about simplifying the left-hand side of the inequality?\n3. What restrictions, if any, do we need to consider when simplifying the inequality?\n4. Once we have simplified the inequality, what is the next step in finding the solution set?\n5. How do we typically represent solution sets for inequalities? Why is interval notation commonly used?\n6. What would happen if we set the denominator equal to zero? How does this affect the solution set?\n7. Is it possible for $\\frac{x-1}{x-3}$ to be less than zero? If so, what values of $x$ satisfy this?\n8. Can you think of other similar inequalities that use rational expressions? How might we approach solving these inequalities using the same method?"
