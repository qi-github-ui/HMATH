    "problem": "For what values of the constant $c$ does the graph of $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x+c}{x^2+x-6}$ have exactly one vertical asymptote?\n\nEnter the possible values of $c,$ separated by commas.",

    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We can factor the denominator to get $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x+c}{(x-2)(x+3)}$. Hence, the graph of $f(x)$ has vertical asymptotes at $x=2$ and $x=-3$, unless there is a factor of $x-2$ or $x+3$ in the numerator that cancels out the corresponding factor in the denominator (in this case there will be a hole at that point rather than an asymptote).\n\nBy the Factor theorem, if $x^2-x+c$ has a factor of $x-2$, we must have $2^2-2+c=0$ which gives us $c=-2$. Similarly, if $x^2-x+c$ has a factor of $x+3$, we must have $3^2+3+c=0$ which gives us $c=-12$. Therefore, in order to have exactly one asymptote, we need $c = \\boxed{-2 \\text{ or } -12}$.",

What does it mean for a rational function to have exactly one vertical asymptote?\n4. Given the rational function $f(x) = \\frac{x^2-x+c}{x^2+x-6}$, how can we determine if it has only one vertical asymptote?\n5. What condition(s) must be met in order for a factor in the denominator to be canceled out by a factor in the numerator, resulting in a hole instead of an asymptote?\n6. What are the factors of the denominator $(x-2)(x+3)$? \n7. Under what conditions should there be no hole at $x = 2$ and $x = -3$? \n8. How can we apply the Factor theorem to find the possible values of $c$?\n9. What values of $c$ satisfy the equation $2^2 - 2 + c = 0$?\n10. What values of $c$ satisfy the equation $3^2 + 3 + c = 0$?\n11. Considering the solutions to the equations above, what are the possible values of $c$ that result in exactly one vertical asymptote for the graph of $f(x)$?"
