    "problem": "Which type of conic section is described by the equation \\[(x+5)^2 = (4y-3)^2 - 140?\\]Enter \"C\" for circle, \"P\" for parabola, \"E\" for ellipse, \"H\" for hyperbola, and \"N\" for none of the above.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "If we were to expand the given equation and move all the terms to the left-hand side, we would have a $x^2$ term and a $-16y^2$ term. Because the coefficients of the $x^2$ and $y^2$ terms have opposite signs, this conic section must be a $\\boxed{(\\text{H})}$ hyperbola.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the process of expanding and rearranging the given equation to determine the type of conic section?\n2. How can you determine the type of conic section based on the coefficients of the x^2 and y^2 terms?\n3. Why do the opposite signs of the coefficients of the x^2 and y^2 terms indicate that this conic section is a hyperbola?\n4. Are there any other characteristics or terms in the equation that support the determination of a hyperbola?\n5. Can you think of any other equations that might have similar characteristics and require similar steps to determine the type of conic section?"
