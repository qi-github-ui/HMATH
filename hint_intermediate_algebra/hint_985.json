In general,\n\\[b_{3m} = -\\frac{1}{m + 1}.\\]Then\n\\[a_{3m} = \\frac{b_{3m} + 1}{2} = \\frac{-1/(m + 1) + 1}{2} = \\frac{m}{2(m + 1)}.\\]In particular,\n\\[a_{120} = \\frac{40}{2(40 + 1)} = \\boxed{\\frac{20}{41}}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given sequence defined by? Can you identify any patterns or initial values?\n2. What is the relationship between successive terms in the sequence? How can we obtain each term from the previous ones?\n3. Can we rewrite the recursive definition of the sequence in a more simplified form? What manipulations can be done to achieve this?\n4. What happens if we substitute a new sequence, $(b_n)$, defined as $b_n = 2a_n - 1$? How does this relate to the original sequence?\n5. How does the new sequence, $(b_n)$, evolve as $n$ increases? Are there any patterns or recurring values?\n6. Can we find a relationship between the terms of $(b_n)$ and $(b_{n+m})$, where $m$ is a positive integer? What does this tell us about the behavior of $(b_n)$?\n7. How can we determine the terms of the original sequence, $(a_n)$, using the terms of $(b_n)$? Is there a formula that relates $a_n$ to $b_n$?\n8. How does the value of $a_n$ change as $n$ increases? Are there any specific values of $n$ that yield interesting results?\n9. What can we conclude about the behavior of the sequence $(a_n)$ based on our observations from the new sequence $(b_n)$?\n10. Finally, what is the value of $a_{120}$? How can we use our previous findings to determine this value?"
