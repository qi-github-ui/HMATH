    "solution": "Recall that a parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus $F$ and the directrix.\n\nSince the parabola $x = -\\frac{1}{12} y^2$ is symmetric about the $x$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(f,0).$  Let $x = d$ be the equation of the directrix.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1.5 cm);\n\npair F, P, Q;\n\nF = (-1/4,0);\nP = (-1,1);\nQ = (-1/4,1);\n\nreal parab (real x) {\n  return(-x^2);\n}\n\ndraw(reflect((0,0),(1,1))*graph(parab,-1.5,1.5),red);\ndraw((1/4,-1.5)--(1/4,1.5),dashed);\ndraw(P--F);\ndraw(P--Q);\n\ndot(\"$F$\", F, SW);\ndot(\"$P$\", P, N);\ndot(\"$Q$\", Q, E);\n[/asy]\n\nLet $\\left( -\\frac{1}{12} y^2, y \\right)$ be a point on the parabola $x = -\\frac{1}{12} y^2.$  Then\n\\[PF^2 = \\left( -\\frac{1}{12} y^2 - f \\right)^2 + y^2\\]and $PQ^2 = \\left( -\\frac{1}{12} y^2 - d \\right)^2.$  Thus,\n\\[\\left( -\\frac{1}{12} y^2 - f \\right)^2 + y^2 = \\left( -\\frac{1}{12} y^2 - d \\right)^2.\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[\\frac{1}{144} y^4 + \\frac{f}{6} y^2 + f^2 + y^2 = \\frac{1}{144} y^4 + \\frac{d}{6} y^2 + d^2.\\]Matching coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{f}{6} + 1 &= \\frac{d}{6}, \\\\\nf^2 &= d^2.\n\\end{align*}From the first equation, $d - f = 6.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $-2f = 6,$ so $f = -3.$\n\nThus, the focus $\\boxed{(-3,0)}.$",
