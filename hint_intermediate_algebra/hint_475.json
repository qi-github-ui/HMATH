    "solution": "By Vieta's formulas, $a + b + c = -3,$ so $P(-3) = -16.$\n\nLet $Q(x) = P(x) + x + 3.$  Then\n\\begin{align*}\nQ(a) &= b + c + a + 3 = 0, \\\\\nQ(b) &= a + c + b + 3 = 0, \\\\\nQ(c) &= a + b + c + 3 = 0, \\\\\nQ(-3) &= P(-3) - 3 + 3 = -16.\n\\end{align*}Hence, $Q(x) = k(x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = k(x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x + 7)$ for some constant $k.$  Setting $x = -3,$ we get\n\\[-16 = -8k,\\]so $k = 2.$  Then $Q(x) = 2(x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x + 7),$ so\n\\[P(x) = Q(x) - x - 3 = 2(x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x + 7) - x - 3 = \\boxed{2x^3 + 6x^2 + 9x + 11}.\\]",
