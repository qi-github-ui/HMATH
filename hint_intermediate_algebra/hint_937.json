    "solution": "Let\n\\[f(a,b,c,d) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 - (ab + \\lambda bc + cd).\\]For fixed values of $b,$ $c,$ and $d,$ $f(a,b,c,d)$ is minimized when $a = \\frac{b}{2}.$  Similarly, for fixed values of $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $f(a,b,c,d)$ is minimized when $d = \\frac{c}{2}.$  Thus, it suffices to look at the case where $a = \\frac{b}{2}$ and $d = \\frac{c}{2},$ in which case the given inequality becomes\n\\[\\frac{5b^2}{4} + \\frac{5c^2}{4} \\ge \\frac{b^2}{2} + \\lambda bc + \\frac{c^2}{2},\\]or $5b^2 + 5c^2 \\ge 2b^2 + 4 \\lambda bc + 2c^2.$  This reduces to\n\\[3b^2 + 3c^2 \\ge 4 \\lambda bc.\\]Taking $b = c = 1,$ we find $6 \\ge 4 \\lambda,$ so $\\lambda \\le \\frac{3}{2}.$\n\nOn the other hand, if $\\lambda = \\frac{3}{2},$ then the inequality above becomes\n\\[3b^2 + 3c^2 \\ge 6bc,\\]which holds due to AM-GM.  Therefore, the largest such $\\lambda$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.$",

How does it affect the terms involving $b$ and $c$?\n3. Can you identify any characteristics or patterns in the terms of the inequality that might be helpful in finding the largest $\\lambda$?\n4. Are there any restrictions on the values of $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ in the inequality? How might these restrictions impact the determination of the largest $\\lambda$?\n5. What happens to the expression $f(a,b,c,d)$ when $a=\\frac{b}{2}$ and $d=\\frac{c}{2}$? Can you simplify the inequality using these substitutions?\n6. What does the inequality $3b^2 + 3c^2 \\ge 4\\lambda bc$ imply about the relationship between $b$ and $c$? Can you determine any restrictions on the values of $\\lambda$ based on this inequality?\n7. Can you find a specific value of $b$ and $c$ that satisfies the inequality $3b^2 + 3c^2 \\ge 4\\lambda bc$ for a given $\\lambda$?
