    "solution": "Since $x^2 + 2x + 7 = (x + 1)^2 + 6 > 0$ for all $x,$ the sign of $\\frac{x + 6}{x^2 + 2x + 7}$ is the same as the sign of $x + 6.$  Thus, the solution is $x \\in \\boxed{[-6,\\infty)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step in solving the inequality $\\frac{x + 6}{x^2 + 2x + 7} \\ge 0?$ \n2. How do you determine the sign of $\\frac{x + 6}{x^2 + 2x + 7}$ based on the denominator $x^2 + 2x + 7?$ \n3. Can you find the critical points of the function $\\frac{x + 6}{x^2 + 2x + 7}$ and what do they represent in terms of the solution to the inequality? \n4. How do you use test points to determine the intervals where the inequality $\\frac{x + 6}{x^2 + 2x + 7} \\ge 0$ is satisfied? \n5. Are there any restrictions on the value of $x$ based on the denominator $x^2 + 2x + 7$ and why? \n6. Can you generalize the process of solving rational inequalities like this to other examples and what considerations should be taken into account?"
