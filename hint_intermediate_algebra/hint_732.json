    "problem": "You have a rectangular prism box with length $x+5$ units, width $x-5$ units, and height $x^{2}+25$ units. For how many positive integer values of $x$ is the volume of the box less than 700 units?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "To find the volume of the box, we multiply the three dimensions: $(x+5)(x-5)(x^{2}+25) = (x^{2}-25)(x^{2}+25) = x^{4}-625$. We want to find $x$ such that $x^{4}-625<700$, which simplifies to $x^{4}<1325$. Taking the fourth root shows us that $x$ is less than $\\sqrt[4]{1325}$, which is between 6 and 7 (since $6^4=1296$ while $7^4=2401$). So $x$ could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, we see that the width is $x-5$ units, and this must be a positive number, so the only value of $x$ which works is 6. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ possible value of $x$.",

Can you write the formula?\n3. Can you simplify the expression for the volume of the box using algebraic manipulation?\n4. What is the inequality that represents the condition for the volume to be less than 700 units?\n5. How can we solve the inequality $x^4 < 1325$ to find the possible values of x?\n6. Why do we take the fourth root to solve the inequality? What does it tell us about x?\n7. After evaluating the fourth root expression, what range of values does x fall into?\n8. Are all the values within the range of x valid solutions? Why or why not?\n9. How does the width of the box affect the possible values of x? Can you explain why?\n10. Based on the condition that the width must be positive, how many positive integer values of x satisfy the given condition?"
