    "problem": "Find the range of the function\n\\[h(x) = \\frac{2(x + 7)(x - 3)}{x + 7}.\\]",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "If $x \\neq -7,$ then we can cancel the factors of $x + 7$ to get\n\\[h(x) = 2(x - 3).\\]If $x$ were allowed to be any real number, then $2(x - 3)$ could also be any real number.  However, the function is not defined for $x = -7,$ so the function cannot take on the value $2(-7 - 3) = -20.$\n\nTherefore, the range of the function is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-20) \\cup (-20,\\infty)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the function h(x) represents in this context?\n2. Can you tell me what the domain of this function is?\n3. If we simplify the function by canceling the common factor, what does the simplified function represent?\n4. What happens to the function at x = -7, and why is this important?\n5. Based on this information, what is the possible range of the function? \n6. Can you find any values that are not in the range of the function?"
