    "solution": "This problem illustrates how algebra can clarify arithmetic.  Comparing these quantities directly is a chore.  Instead, we note that the first and third choices are both of the form $\\frac{n}{n-1}+\\frac{n}{n+1}$ for $n=2006$ and $n=2007$.  Rewriting this expression algebraically leads to \\[ \\frac{n(n+1)}{n^2-1}+\\frac{n(n-1)}{n^2-1} = \\frac{2n^2}{n^2-1} = 2 + \\frac{2}{n^2-1}. \\]In particular both $A$ and $C$ are larger than 2.  It is easy to verify that choice $B$ is equal to 2, so it cannot be the answer.  Finally, note that larger values of $n$ produce smaller results, implying that $\\boxed{\\text{A}}$ is the largest.  (It is also possible to guess the answer by trying examples involving much smaller numbers.)",
