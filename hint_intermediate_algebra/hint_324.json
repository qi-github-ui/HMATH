    "solution": "Let $r,$ $s,$ $t$ be the real roots, so\n\\[r^3 - ar^2 + br - a = 0.\\]If $r$ is negative, then $r^3,$ $-ar^2,$ $br,$ and $-a$ are all negative, so\n\\[r^3 - ar^2 + br - a < 0,\\]contradiction.  Also, $r \\neq 0,$ so $r$ is positive.  Similarly, $s$ and $t$ are positive.\n\nBy Vieta's formulas, $r + s + t = a$ and $rst = a.$  By AM-GM,\n\\[\\frac{r + s + t}{3} \\ge \\sqrt[3]{rst}.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{a}{3} \\ge \\sqrt[3]{a}.\\]Hence, $a \\ge 3 \\sqrt[3]{a},$ so $a^3 \\ge 27a.$  Since $a$ is positive, $a^2 \\ge 27,$ so $a \\ge 3 \\sqrt{3}.$\n\nEquality occurs if and only if $r = s = t = \\sqrt{3},$ so the cubic is\n\\[(x - \\sqrt{3})^3 = x^3 - 3x^2 \\sqrt{3} + 9x - 3 \\sqrt{3} = 0.\\]Thus, $b = \\boxed{9}.$",

Why does the problem specify a smallest positive real number for $a$ and a unique value for $b$?\n5. What can we infer about the roots of the polynomial based on the given information?\n6. How can we use Vieta's formulas to establish relationships among the roots and the coefficients of the polynomial?\n7. How does Vieta's formula for the sum of the roots relate to the value of $a$? What about Vieta's formula for the product of the roots?\n8. Can you apply the AM-GM inequality to the sum and product of the roots to derive any useful inequalities?\n9. How can we justify that $a$ must be greater than or equal to $3 \\sqrt{3}$?\n10. Can you find an example where $a = 3 \\sqrt{3}$ and determine the corresponding value of $b$?\n11. Is there more than one set of roots that satisfy the conditions of the problem? How can we prove or disprove this?"
