    "solution": "Let $(a,b)$ be the center of a circle that is tangent to $C_1$ and $C_2,$ and let $r$ be the radius.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\npair A, B, O, P, Q;\n\nO = (0,0);\nP = (2,0);\nQ = (1,sqrt(21)/2);\nA = intersectionpoint(O--Q,Circle(Q,1.5));\nB = intersectionpoint(Q--interp(P,Q,2),Circle(Q,1.5));\n\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\ndraw(Circle(P,4));\ndraw(Circle(Q,1.5));\ndraw(O--Q);\ndraw(P--B);\n\nlabel(\"$r$\", (Q + A)/2, NW);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (Q + B)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$1$\", (O + A)/2, NW);\nlabel(\"$4 - r$\", (P + Q)/2, NE, UnFill);\nlabel(\"$C_1$\", dir(225), dir(225));\nlabel(\"$C_2$\", P + 4*dir(70), dir(70));\n\ndot(\"$(0,0)$\", O, S);\ndot(\"$(2,0)$\", P, S);\ndot(A);\ndot(B);\ndot(\"$(a,b)$\", Q, NE);\n[/asy]\n\nThen the square of the distance of the center of this circle from the center of $C_1$ is $a^2 + b^2 = (r + 1)^2$ and the square of the distance of the center of this circle from the center of $C_2$ is $(a - 2)^2 + b^2 = (4 - r)^2.$  Subtracting these equations, we get\n\\[a^2 - (a - 2)^2 = (r + 1)^2 - (4 - r)^2.\\]This simplifies to $4a - 4 = 10r - 15,$ so $r = \\frac{4a + 11}{10}.$\n\nSubstituting into the equation $a^2 + b^2 = (r + 1)^2,$ we get\n\\[a^2 + b^2 = \\left( \\frac{4a + 21}{10} \\right)^2.\\]This simplifies to $\\boxed{84a^2 + 100b^2 - 168a - 441 = 0}.$",
