    "problem": "Let $a_1 , a_2 , \\dots$ be a sequence for which  $a_1=2$ , $a_2=3$, and $a_n=\\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n-2}}$ for each positive integer $n \\ge 3$.  What is $a_{2006}$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We have that\n\\begin{align*}\na_3 &= \\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{3}{2}, \\\\\na_4 &= \\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \\frac{3/2}{3} = \\frac{1}{2}, \\\\\na_5 &= \\frac{a_4}{a_3} = \\frac{1/2}{3/2} = \\frac{1}{3}, \\\\\na_6 &= \\frac{a_5}{a_4} = \\frac{1/3}{1/2} = \\frac{2}{3}, \\\\\na_7 &= \\frac{a_6}{a_5} = \\frac{2/3}{1/3} = 2, \\\\\na_8 &= \\frac{a_7}{a_6} = \\frac{2}{2/3} = 3.\n\\end{align*}Since $a_7 = a_1 = 2$ and $a_8 = a_2 = 3,$ and each term depends only on the previous two terms, the sequence becomes periodic at this point, with a period of length 6.  Hence, $a_{2006} = a_2 = \\boxed{3}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the first three terms of the sequence?\n2. How is each subsequent term calculated?\n3. What is the relationship between $a_7$ and $a_1$? And between $a_8$ and $a_2$?\n4. Is there a pattern or repetition in the sequence?\n5. If the sequence becomes periodic, what is the length of each period?\n6. How can we find $a_{2006}$ using the periodicity of the sequence?\n7. Can we generalize a formula for the $n$th term of the sequence based on the periodicity?"
