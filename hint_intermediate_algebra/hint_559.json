    "solution": "Let $a = 2^x$ and $b = 3^x.$  Then the given equation becomes\n\\[\\frac{a^3 + b^3}{a^2 b + ab^2} = \\frac{7}{6}.\\]We can factor, to get\n\\[\\frac{(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)}{ab(a + b)} = \\frac{7}{6}.\\]Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $a + b$ must be positive, so we can safely cancel the factors of $a + b,$ to get\n\\[\\frac{a^2 - ab + b^2}{ab} = \\frac{7}{6}.\\]Then $6a^2 - 6ab + 6b^2 = 7ab,$ which simplifies to $6a^2 - 13ab + 6b^2 = 0.$  This equation factors as $(2a - 3b)(3a - 2b) = 0,$ so $2a = 3b$ or $3a = 2b.$\n\nIf $2a = 3b,$ then $2^{x + 1} = 3^{x + 1},$ or\n\\[\\frac{2^{x + 1}}{3^{x + 1}} = \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^{x + 1} = 1.\\]The only solution here is $x = -1.$\n\nIf $3a = 2b,$ then $3 \\cdot 2^x = 2 \\cdot 3^x,$ or\n\\[\\frac{3 \\cdot 2^x}{2 \\cdot 3^x} = \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^{x - 1} = 1.\\]The only solution here is $x = 1.$\n\nTherefore, the solutions are $\\boxed{-1,1}.$",
