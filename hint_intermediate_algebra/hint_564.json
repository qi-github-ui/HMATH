    "problem": "Consider sequences of positive real numbers of the form $x, 2000, y, \\dots$ in which every term after the first is 1 less than the product of its two immediate neighbors. For how many different values of $x$ does the term 2001 appear somewhere in the sequence?",

    "solution": "Suppose $a,$ $b,$ $c$ are three consecutive terms of the sequence.  Then $b = ac - 1,$ so\n\\[c = \\frac{b + 1}{a}.\\]Let $a_n$ denote the $n$th term.  Then $a_1 = x,$ $a_2 = 2000,$ and\n\\begin{align*}\na_3 &= \\frac{a_2 + 1}{a_1} = \\frac{2001}{x}, \\\\\na_4 &= \\frac{a_3 + 1}{a_2} = \\frac{2001/x + 1}{2000} = \\frac{x + 2001}{2000x}, \\\\\na_5 &= \\frac{(x + 2001)/(2000x) + 1}{2001/x} = \\frac{x + 1}{2000}, \\\\\na_6 &= \\frac{(x + 1)/2000 + 1}{(x + 2001)/(2000x)} = x, \\\\\na_7 &= \\frac{x + 1}{(x + 1)/2000} = 2000.\n\\end{align*}Since $a_6 = a_1$ and $a_7 = a_2,$ and each term depends only on the previous two terms, the sequence becomes periodic from this point, with period 5.  Therefore, the first five terms represent all possible values.\n\nWe can have $a_1 = x = 2001.$\n\nWe can have $a_3 = \\frac{2001}{x} = 2001,$ which leads to\n\\[x = 1.\\]We can have $a_4 = \\frac{x + 2001}{2000x} = 2001,$ which leads to\n\\[x = \\frac{2001}{4001999}.\\]We can have $a_5 = \\frac{x + 1}{2000} = 2001,$ which leads to\n\\[x = 4001999.\\]Thus, there are $\\boxed{4}$ different possible values of $x.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem? What does it mean for a sequence to be of the form $x, 2000, y, \\dots$?\n2. How can we express the relationship between consecutive terms in this sequence mathematically? What equation can we write based on this relationship?\n3. Given that $b = ac - 1$, can we solve for $c$ in terms of $a$ and $b$? What does this tell us about the third term in the sequence?\n4. Can we continue this pattern to find the fourth and fifth terms in the sequence? What relationship can we observe between the terms $a_1$ and $a_6$, and between $a_2$ and $a_7$?\n5. What can we conclude about the periodicity of the sequence based on the observation in the previous question? How does this help us determine the possible values of $x$?\n6. What are the specific values of $x$ that make the term 2001 appear somewhere in the sequence? How many different values of $x$ are there?\n7. Can you explain the reasoning and steps you took to find the four different possible values of $x$ that satisfy the given condition?\n8. Are there any other similar sequences or patterns that you can think of where you can apply the same reasoning and steps to find the values of certain terms?\n9. How does understanding the relationships and patterns in this sequence help develop critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities in algebra?"
