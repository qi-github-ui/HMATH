    "problem": "How many integers $-11 \\leq n \\leq 11$ satisfy $(n-2)(n+4)(n + 8)<0$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $(n-2)(n+4)(n+8)=0$ when $n=2, -4,$ or $-8$, we will consider the four cases $-11 \\leq n < -8$, $-8<n<-4$, $-4<n<2$, and $2<n\\leq 11$ separately. If $n=2$, $n=-4$, or $n=-8$, then all three factors are 0.   If $n>2$, then all three factors are positive. If $-4<n<2$, then $n-2$ is negative, while the other two factors are positive, so the product is negative. If $-8<n<-4$, then $n+8$ is positive, while the other two factors are negative, so the product is positive. If $n<-8$, then all three factors are negative, so the product is negative. In total, there are $\\boxed{8}$ solutions: $-11,-10,-9,-3,-2,-1,0,1$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given inequality and what is it asking us to find?\n2. How many solutions are possible for the given inequality?\n3. What are the possible values of $n$ that make each factor positive, negative, or zero?\n4. How do we determine the sign of the product of the three factors for each range of values of $n$?\n5. Can we verify that the solutions we found indeed satisfy the given inequality?\n6. Are there any other methods we can use to solve this type of inequality?"
