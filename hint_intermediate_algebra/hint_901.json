    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Taking $x = 2$ and $y = 2,$ we get\n\\[f(4) = f(2) f(2) = 9.\\]Taking $x = 4$ and $y = 2,$ we get\n\\[f(6) = f(4) f(2) = \\boxed{27}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the equation that defines the function $f(x)$? \n2. Can you give an example of two real numbers $x$ and $y$ for which $f(x+y) \\neq f(x) f(y)$ ? \n3. Is $f(0) = 1$ true? If yes, why? If not, what would $f(0)$ be? \n4. What is the value of $f(1)$? Can you prove it? \n5. Given that $f(2) = 3$, what is the value of $f(4)$? How did you get to your answer? \n6. With $f(2) = 3$, what is the value of $f(6)$? Can you explain step by step using the given equation? \n7. Can you think of any other function that satisfies the same equation? What are their similarities and differences compared to $f(x)$?"
