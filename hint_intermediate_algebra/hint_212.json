    "solution": "Setting $y = 0$ in the given functional equation, we get\n\\[f(0) + x = xf(0) + f(x),\\]so $f(x) = (1 - f(0))x + f(0).$  This tells us that $f(x)$ is a linear function of the form $f(x) = mx + b.$  Since $f(-1) = 5,$ $5 = -m + b,$ so $b = m + 5,$ and\n\\[f(x) = mx + m + 5.\\]Substituting this into the given functional equation, we get\n\\[mxy + m + 5 + x = x(my + m + 5) + mx + m + 5.\\]This simplifies to $2mx = -4x.$  For this to hold for all $x,$ we must have $m = -2.$\n\nThen $f(x) = -2x + 3.$  In particular, $f(-1001) = \\boxed{2005}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the given functional equation in your own words? What does it tell us about the function $f(x)$?\n2. What can we learn by substituting $y = 0$ into the functional equation? How does this help us characterize the function $f(x)$?\n3. Based on the information obtained from substituting $y = 0$, what form does the function $f(x)$ take? Can you express $f(x)$ as a linear function? If so, can you determine the values of $m$ and $b$?\n4. Substituting the linear form of $f(x)$ into the original functional equation, what additional information can we gather about the function parameters $m$ and $b$?\n5. By simplifying the equation obtained in question 4, what values can we deduce for the parameter $m$?\n6. Using the values of $m$ and $b$ obtained above, what is the explicit expression for the function $f(x)$?\n7. To find $f(-1001)$, how do we evaluate the function $f(x)$ at $x = -1001$? What value does that give us?"
