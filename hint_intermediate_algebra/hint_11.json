    "solution": "We have that\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x) f(-x) &= (ax^2 + bx + c)(ax^2 - bx + c) \\\\\n&= (ax^2 + c)^2 - (bx)^2 \\\\\n&= a^2 x^4 + 2acx^2 + c^2 - b^2 x^2.\n\\end{align*}We want this to equal $f(x^2) = ax^4 + bx^2 + c.$  Comparing coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 &= a, \\\\\n2ac - b^2 &= b, \\\\\nc^2 &= c.\n\\end{align*}Thus, $a = 0$ or $a = 1,$ and $c = 0$ or $c = 1.$  We divide into cases accordingly.\n\nIf $a = 0$ or $c = 0,$ then $ac = 0,$ so\n\\[b^2 + b = b(b + 1) = 0,\\]which means $b = 0$ or $b = -1.$\n\nThe only other case is where $a = 1$ and $c = 1.$  Then\n\\[b^2 + b - 2 = 0,\\]which factors as $(b - 1)(b + 2) = 0.$  Hence, $b = 1$ or $b = -2.$\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{8}$ such functions $f(x)$:\n\\[0, 1, -x, 1 - x, x^2, x^2 - x, x^2 + x + 1, x^2 - 2x + 1.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ looks like in general?\n2. What does it mean for two functions to be equal? How does that relate to $f(x) f(-x) = f(x^2)$?\n3. What can we determine about the coefficients $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ by expanding $f(x) f(-x)$ and comparing to $f(x^2)$?\n4. How do we use the relationships between the coefficients to find all possible solutions for $f(x)$?\n5. Can you walk me through the different cases where $a$ and $c$ are either 0 or 1, respectively? How many solutions do we get in each case?\n6. Are there any other values of $a$ and $c$ that we haven't considered yet? Why or why not?\n7. How do we know that we've found all the possible solutions for $f(x)$? Is there a way to check our answer?"
