    "solution": "Seeing the expression $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ twice, we make the substitution $y = \\sqrt[3]{x},$ so that our inequality becomes \\[y + \\frac{2}{y+3} \\le 0.\\]Combining the terms on the left-hand side under a common denominator, we get \\[\\frac{y^2+3y+2}{y+3} \\le 0,\\]which factors as \\[\\frac{(y+1)(y+2)}{y+3} \\le 0.\\]Letting $f(y) = (y+1)(y+2)/(y+3),$ we make a sign table based on this inequality: \\begin{tabular}{c|ccc|c} &$y+1$ &$y+2$ &$y+3$ &$f(y)$ \\\\ \\hline$y<-3$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$-3<y<-2$ &$-$&$-$&$+$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]$-2<y<-1$ &$-$&$+$&$+$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$y>-1$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]\\end{tabular}Therefore, the inequality holds if $y < -3$ or $-2 < y < -1.$ Since the inequality is nonstrict, we must also include the values of $y$ that make $f(y) = 0,$ which are $y=-1$ and $y=-2.$ Therefore, the solutions to this inequality are \\[y \\in (-\\infty, -3) \\cup [-2, -1].\\]Since $y = \\sqrt[3]{x},$ we have either $\\sqrt[3]{x} < -3$ or $-2 \\le \\sqrt[3]{x} \\le -1.$ Since $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ is an increasing function of $x,$ we can cube all sides of these inequalities, to get $x < -27$ and $-8 \\le x \\le -1,$ respectively. Therefore, \\[x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty, -27) \\cup [-8, -1]}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the steps you took to substitute $y = \\sqrt[3]{x}$? Why did you make this particular substitution?\n2. Why did you choose to combine the terms on the left-hand side under a common denominator? How is this helpful in solving the inequality?\n3. Can you explain how you factored the inequality: $\\frac{(y+1)(y+2)}{y+3} \\le 0$? What methods did you use?\n4. How did you determine the intervals where the inequality holds true? Can you explain the process you used to create the sign table?\n5. Why did you also include the values of $y$ that make $f(y) = 0$ as solutions to the inequality? How do these values affect the inequality?\n6. How did you convert the solutions in terms of $y$ back to solutions in terms of $x$? Can you explain the steps used to obtain the solution in interval notation?"
