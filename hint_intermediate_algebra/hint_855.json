    "problem": "A real number $a$ is chosen randomly and uniformly from the interval $[-20, 18]$. Find the probability that the roots of the polynomial\n\\[x^4 + 2ax^3 + (2a - 2)x^2 + (-4a + 3)x - 2\\]are all real.",

    "solution": "Let $p(x)$ be the given polynomial. Notice that \\[p(1) = 1 + (2a) + (2a-2) - (4a+3) - 2 = 0,\\]so $1$ is a root of $p(x).$ Performing polynomial division, we then have \\[p(x) = (x-1)(x^3+(2a+1)x^2+(4a-1)x+2).\\]Notice that \\[p(-2) = 1 \\cdot (-8 + 4(2a+1) - 2(4a-1) + 2) = 0,\\]so $-2$ is a root of $p(x)$ as well. Dividing the cubic term by $x+2,$ we then have \\[p(x) = (x-1)(x+2)(x^2+(2a-1)x+1).\\]Therefore, we want to find the probability that the roots of $x^2 + (2a-1)x + 1$ are all real. This occurs if and only if the discriminant is nonnegative: \\[(2a-1)^2 - 4 \\ge 0,\\]or $(2a-1)^2 \\ge 4.$ Thus, either $2a-1 \\ge 2$ or $2a-1 \\le -2.$ The first inequality is equivalent to $a \\ge \\tfrac{3}{2},$ and the second is equivalent to $a \\le -\\tfrac{1}{2}.$ This shows that all values of $a$ except those in the interval $\\left(-\\tfrac12, \\tfrac32\\right)$ satisfy the condition. This interval has length $2,$ and the given interval $[-20, 18],$ which contains it completely, has length $18 - (-20) = 38,$ so the probability is \\[1 - \\frac{2}{38} = \\boxed{\\frac{18}{19}}.\\]",
