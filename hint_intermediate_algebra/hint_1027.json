    "solution": "First, note that\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x,y,z) &= \\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x} \\\\\n&> \\frac{x}{x + y + z} + \\frac{y}{y + z + x} + \\frac{z}{z + x + y} \\\\\n&= \\frac{x + y + z}{x + y + z} = 1.\n\\end{align*}Let $\\epsilon$ be a small positive number.  Then\n\\begin{align*}\nf(\\epsilon^2,\\epsilon,1) &= \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{\\epsilon^2 + \\epsilon} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\epsilon^2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon + 1} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon + 1} + \\frac{1}{1 + \\epsilon^2}.\n\\end{align*}As $\\epsilon$ approaches 0, $f(\\epsilon^2,\\epsilon,1)$ approaches 1.  This means we can make $f(x,y,z)$ arbitrarily close to 1, without actually reaching 1.\n\nNow, note that\n\\[f(x,y,z) + f(x,z,y) = \\frac{x}{x + y} + \\frac{y}{y + z} + \\frac{z}{z + x} + \\frac{x}{x + z} + \\frac{z}{z + y} + \\frac{y}{x + y} = 3.\\]Therefore, $f(x,y,z) < 2,$ and we can make $f(x,y,z)$ arbitrarily close to 2.\n\nHence, the set of all possible values of $f(x,y,z)$ is $\\boxed{(1,2)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the given function $f(x,y,z)$ in your own words?\n2. What is the range of the function $f(x,y,z)$ based on the given information? Can you explain why the function is bounded within that range?\n3. Can you explain why $f(x,y,z)$ is always greater than 1? What does this tell us about the relationship between the variables $x,$ $y,$ and $z$?\n4. Let's consider the case where $x = \\epsilon^2,$ $y = \\epsilon,$ and $z = 1,$ where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive number approaching 0. What does $f(\\epsilon^2,\\epsilon,1)$ approach as $\\epsilon$ approaches 0? How does this relate to the bounds of the function?\n5. Can you explain why $f(x,y,z)$ can be made arbitrarily close to 1 without actually reaching 1? What does this suggest about the behavior of the function as the variables vary?\n6. Furthermore, let's explore the relationship between $f(x,y,z)$ and $f(x,z,y).$ Can you explain why the sum of these two functions is always 3? How does this help us determine the upper bound for $f(x,y,z)$?\n7. How does combining the information we have so far help us establish the range of possible values for $f(x,y,z)$? What is the set of all possible values for $f(x,y,z)$ that we can conclude from our findings?"
