    "solution": "By the triangle inequality, a nondegenerate triangle with these side lengths exists if and only if \\[\\left\\{ \\begin{aligned}\\log_{10} 75 + \\log_{10} n &> \\log_{10} 12, \\\\ \\log_{10}12 + \\log_{10} 75 &> \\log_{10} n, \\\\ \\log_{10} 12 + \\log_{10} n &> \\log_{10} 75. \\end{aligned} \\right.\\]The first inequality is always true, because $\\log_{10} 75 > \\log_{10} 12$ and $\\log_{10} n > 0.$\n\nThe second inequality gives $\\log_{10}(12 \\cdot 75) > \\log_{10} n,$ so $12 \\cdot 75 = 900 > n.$\n\nThe third inequality gives $\\log_{10}(12n) > \\log_{10} 75,$ so $12n > 75,$ or $n > \\tfrac{75}{12} = 6.25.$\n\nThus, the possible values for $n$ are $n = 7, 8, 9, \\ldots, 899,$ which makes $899 - 7 + 1 = \\boxed{893}$ values of $n.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we determine if a triangle with the given side lengths exists? What condition do we need to satisfy?\n2. Based on the triangle inequality, what are the three inequalities that we need to consider?\n3. When examining the first inequality, what can we conclude based on the given side lengths?\n4. In the second inequality, what can we deduce from the fact that $\\log_{10}(12 \\cdot 75) > \\log_{10} n$?\n5. How can we manipulate the second inequality to find a constraint on the value of $n$?\n6. Considering the third inequality, what information can we gather by comparing $\\log_{10}(12n)$ and $\\log_{10} 75$?\n7. How can we solve the third inequality to set an upper limit for the values of $n$?\n8. Combining the results from the second and third inequalities, what is the range of possible values for $n$?\n9. Considering that $n$ is a positive integer, how many values of $n$ are in this range?\n10. What is the final answer to the problem? How many possible values are there for $n$?"
