    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. Can you think of any other ways to approach this problem?\n3. If you try substituting specific values for $x$ and $y$, what patterns do you notice in the equation $f(x + y) = f(x) f(y)$?\n4. What happens if you let $x = y = 0$ in the equation? What does this tell you about the function $f(x)$?\n5. Can you think of any other values of $x$ and $y$ that might help you deduce the possible values of $f(0)$?\n6. Are there any restrictions or limitations on the possible values of $f(0)$, based on the given equation?"
