(k - 1)!] = \\log_{10} (k!)^2,\\]so $100 (k - 2)! (k - 1)! = (k!)^2.$  Then\n\\[100 = \\frac{k! \\cdot k!}{(k - 2)! (k - 1)!} = k(k - 1) \\cdot k = k^3 - k^2.\\]So, $k^3 - k^2 - 100 = 0,$ which factors as $(k - 5)(k^4 + 4k + 20) = 0.$  The quadratic factor has no integer roots, so $k = \\boxed{5}.$",
