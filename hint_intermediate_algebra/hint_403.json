Can you explain each step of subtracting the equations and simplifying? \n5. How did we end up with $(n-1)2^{n+1}$ at the end of the simplification? \n6. How can we use this expression to solve for $n$? \n7. What is the final answer for $n$ and how do you know it is unique? \n8. Can you think of any other problems where the sum of a finite series can be expressed in terms of a power of 2?"
