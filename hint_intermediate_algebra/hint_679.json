    "solution": "Consider the polynomial $q(x) = p(x) - x.$  This polynomial becomes 0 at $x = 1,$ 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, so it has $x - 1,$ $x - 2,$ $x - 3,$ $x - 4,$ $x - 5,$ and $x - 6$ as factors.  Also, $p(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree 6, so $q(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree 6.  Hence,\n\\[q(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)(x - 5)(x - 6).\\]Then $q(7) = 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 720,$ so $p(7) = q(7) + 7 = \\boxed{727}.$",
