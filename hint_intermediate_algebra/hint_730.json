    "solution": "Since the axis of symmetry is parallel to the $x$-axis, and the $y$-coordinate of the focus is 3, the $y$-coordinate of the vertex is also 3.  Since the vertex lies on the $y$-axis, it must be at $(0,3).$  Hence, the equation of the parabola is of the form\n\\[x = k(y - 3)^2.\\][asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\nreal upperparab (real x) {\n  return (sqrt(4*x) + 3);\n}\n\nreal lowerparab (real x) {\n  return (-sqrt(4*x) + 3);\n}\n\ndraw(graph(upperparab,0,2));\ndraw(graph(lowerparab,0,2));\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,6));\ndraw((-1,0)--(3,0));\n\ndot(\"$(1,5)$\", (1,5), NW);\ndot(\"$(0,3)$\", (0,3), W);\n[/asy]\n\nSince the graph passes through $(1,5),$ we can plug in $x = 1$ and $y = 5,$ to get $1 = 4k,$ so $k = \\frac{1}{4}.$\n\nHence, the equation of the parabola is $x = \\frac{1}{4} (y - 3)^2,$ which we write as\n\\[\\boxed{y^2 - 4x - 6y + 9 = 0}.\\]",
