    "solution": "We divide the two given polynomials to obtain \\[\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{x^3} & +3x^2 & +9x & +28 & +\\frac{86}{x-3} \\\\\n\\cline{2-6}\nx-3 & x^4 & +0x^3 & +0x^2 &+ x &+ 2 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{-x^4} & +3x^3 & \\\\ \\cline{2-3}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{0} & 3x^3 & & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & -3x^3 & + 9x^2 & & \\\\ \\cline{3-4}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & 9x^2 & & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & -9x^2 &+27x & \\\\ \\cline{4-5}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & &+28x & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & &-28x & +84 \\\\ \\cline{5-6}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & & & & 86, \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]which shows that the remainder is $\\boxed{86}$. Alternatively, we could use the remainder theorem, which states that the remainder when a polynomial $p(x)$ is divided by $x-a$, the remainder is $p(a)$. We find that the remainder is $3^4+3+2=86$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the polynomial we want to divide and by what polynomial are we dividing?\n2. What is the first step in long division for polynomials?\n3. How do we determine the degree of the polynomial quotient at each step?\n4. How do we determine the term to subtract at each step?\n5. Why do we carry out long division until the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor?\n6. What is the remainder theorem and how does it relate to this problem?\n7. Can we use synthetic division to find the remainder instead of long division? If so, how?"
