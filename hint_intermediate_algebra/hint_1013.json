    "solution": "Since the coefficients of the polynomial are all real, another is the conjugate of $1 - 2i,$ namely $1 + 2i.$  Let $r$ be the third root.  Then the polynomial is\n\\[(x - 1 + 2i)(x - 1 - 2i)(x - r) = x^3 - (r + 2)x^2 + (2r + 5)x - 5r.\\]Then $2r + 5 = -1,$ so $r = -3.$  Then $a = -(r + 2) = 1$ and $b = -5r = 15,$ so $(a,b) = \\boxed{(1,15)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain why the given polynomial has exactly three roots?\n2. How did you determine that the conjugate of $1 - 2i$ is $1 + 2i$?\n3. What does it mean for two complex numbers to be conjugates of each other?\n4. Can you describe how to multiply the factors $(x - 1 + 2i)$ and $(x - 1 - 2i)$ to obtain the quadratic term in the expanded polynomial?\n5. How did you find the value of $r$ for the third root?\n6. What does it mean for a polynomial to have roots that are complex conjugates of each other?\n7. How did you determine the values of $a$ and $b$ using the known roots and factorization?\n8. What is the significance of the ordered pair $(a,b)$ in this problem?"
