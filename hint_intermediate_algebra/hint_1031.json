    "solution": "We can assume that the ellipse is tangent to the circle $(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 1.$  From this equation, $y^2 = 1 - (x - 1)^2.$  Substituting into the equation of the ellipse, we get\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{1 - (x - 1)^2}{b^2} = 1.\\]This simplifies to\n\\[(a^2 - b^2) x^2 - 2a^2 x + a^2 b^2 = 0.\\]By symmetry, the $x$-coordinates of both tangent points will be equal, so the discriminant of this quadratic will be 0:\n\\[(2a^2)^2 - 4(a^2 - b^2)(a^2 b^2) = 0.\\]This simplifies to $a^4 b^2 = a^4 + a^2 b^4.$  We can divide both sides by $a^2$ to get\n\\[a^2 b^2 = a^2 + b^4.\\]Then\n\\[a^2 = \\frac{b^4}{b^2 - 1}.\\]The area of the ellipse is $\\pi ab.$  Minimizing this is equivalent to minimizing $ab,$ which in turn is equivalent to minimizing\n\\[a^2 b^2 = \\frac{b^6}{b^2 - 1}.\\]Let $t = b^2,$ so\n\\[\\frac{b^6}{b^2 - 1} = \\frac{t^3}{t - 1}.\\]Then let $u = t - 1.$  Then $t = u + 1,$ so\n\\[\\frac{t^3}{t - 1} = \\frac{(u + 1)^3}{u} = u^2 + 3u + 3 + \\frac{1}{u}.\\]By AM-GM,\n\\begin{align*}\nu^2 + 3u + \\frac{1}{u} &= u^2 + \\frac{u}{2} + \\frac{u}{2} + \\frac{u}{2} + \\frac{u}{2} + \\frac{u}{2} + \\frac{u}{2} + \\frac{1}{8u} + \\frac{1}{8u} + \\frac{1}{8u} + \\frac{1}{8u} + \\frac{1}{8u} + \\frac{1}{8u} + \\frac{1}{8u} + \\frac{1}{8u} \\\\\n&\\ge 15 \\sqrt{u^2 \\cdot \\frac{u^6}{2^6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{8^8 u^8}} = \\frac{15}{4}.\n\\end{align*}Equality occurs when $u = \\frac{1}{2}.$  For this value of $u,$ $t = \\frac{3}{2},$ $b = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{2},$ and $a = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2}}{2}.$  Hence,\n\\[k = ab = \\boxed{\\frac{3 \\sqrt{3}}{2}}.\\]",
