    "solution": "Moving all the terms to the left-hand side, we have \\[\\frac{1}{x(x+1)}-\\frac{1}{(x+1)(x+2)}-\\frac13 <0.\\]To solve this inequality, we find a common denominator: \\[\\frac{3(x+2) - 3x - x(x+1)(x+2)}{3x(x+1)(x+2)} < 0,\\]which simplifies to \\[\\frac{6-x(x+1)(x+2)}{3x(x+1)(x+2)} < 0.\\]To factor the numerator, we observe that $x=1$ makes the numerator zero, so $x-1$ is a factor of the expression. Performing polynomial division, we get \\[6 - x(x+1)(x+2) = -(x-1)(x^2+4x+6).\\]Therefore, we want the values of $x$ such that \\[\\frac{(x-1)(x^2+4x+6)}{x(x+1)(x+2)}> 0.\\]Notice that $x^2+4x+6 = (x+2)^2 + 2,$ which is always positive, so this inequality is equivalent to \\[f(x) = \\frac{x-1}{x(x+1)(x+2)}> 0.\\]To solve this inequality, we make the following sign table:\\begin{tabular}{c|cccc|c} &$x$ &$x-1$ &$x+1$ &$x+2$ &$f(x)$ \\\\ \\hline$x<-2$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]$-2<x<-1$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$+$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$-1<x<0$ &$-$&$-$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]$0<x<1$ &$+$&$-$&$+$&$+$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$x>1$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]\\end{tabular}Putting it all together, the solutions to the inequality are \\[x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,-2) \\cup (-1,0)\\cup (1, \\infty)}.\\]",
