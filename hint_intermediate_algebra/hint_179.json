    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "From the given information, we have that the three numbers $\\sqrt{36+k}, \\; \\sqrt{300+k}, \\; \\sqrt{596+k}$ form an arithmetic progression, in that order. Therefore, we have \\[2\\sqrt{300+k} = \\sqrt{36+k} + \\sqrt{596+k}.\\]Squaring both sides of the equation, we get \\[4(300+k) = (36+k) + 2\\sqrt{(36+k)(596+k)} + (596+k)\\]or \\[568 + 2k = 2\\sqrt{(36+k)(596+k)}.\\]Dividing by $2$ and then squaring again, we have \\[(284+k)^2 = (36+k)(596+k),\\]or \\[284^2 + 2 \\cdot 284k + k^2 = 36 \\cdot 596 + 632k + k^2.\\]Thus, \\[k = \\frac{284^2 - 36 \\cdot 596}{632 - 2\\cdot 284} = \\frac{284^2 - 36 \\cdot 596}{64} = \\boxed{925}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How is the given information related to an arithmetic progression?\n2. What relationship does the equation $2\\sqrt{300+k} = \\sqrt{36+k} + \\sqrt{596+k}$ represent?\n3. How did we obtain the equation $4(300+k) = (36+k) + 2\\sqrt{(36+k)(596+k)} + (596+k)$?\n4. Why did we divide by 2 and square the equation $568 + 2k = 2\\sqrt{(36+k)(596+k)}$?\n5. How did we simplify the equation $(284+k)^2 = (36+k)(596+k)$?\n6. What is the value of $k$ that corresponds to $\\frac{284^2 - 36 \\cdot 596}{64}$?\n7. Can you explain why this value of $k$ satisfies the given conditions?"
