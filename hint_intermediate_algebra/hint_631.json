    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "When computing $N$, the number $2^x$ will be added $x$ times (for terms $2^x-2^0$, $2^x-2^1$, $\\dots,$ $2^x - 2^{x-1}$), and subtracted $10-x$ times. Hence, $N$ can be computed as $$N=10\\cdot 2^{10} + 8\\cdot 2^9 + 6\\cdot 2^8 + \\cdots - 8\\cdot 2^1 - 10\\cdot 2^0.$$Then\n\\begin{align*}\nN & = 10(2^{10}-1) + 8(2^9 - 2^1) + 6(2^8-2^2) + 4(2^7-2^3) + 2(2^6-2^4) \\\\\n& = 10(1023) + 8(510) + 6(252) + 4(120) + 2(48) \\\\\n& = 10(1000+23) + 8(500+10) + 6(250+2) + 480 + 96 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{16398}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of set S and what are its elements?\n2. How many elements are there in set S and how can we represent them using exponential notation?\n3. When we take the difference between two elements of set S, what is the minimum and maximum possible value for each difference?\n4. What is the general formula for the difference between two elements $2^a$ and $2^b$ of set S where $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers such that $a>b$?\n5. How can we use the formula from question 4 to compute the sum of all possible positive differences of pairs of elements of set S?\n6. Can we simplify the expression for the sum by using algebraic techniques such as factoring or distributing?\n7. What is the final result of the sum and how can we interpret it in the context of the problem?"
