    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given sequence? \n2. How is each term in the sequence related to the preceding terms? \n3. What does it mean for the last term to be the first negative term encountered? \n4. How can we determine the maximum length of the sequence? \n5. Let's start by calculating a few terms of the sequence. Can you find the values of $a_4,$ $a_5,$ and $a_6$? \n6. Can we find a pattern in the values of the terms? \n7. How can we generalize the sequence for any term $a_n$? Can you write a general formula for $a_n$ in terms of $n$ and $x$? \n8. How can we determine the maximum length of the sequence? \n9. What is the condition for reaching the 12th term of the sequence? \n10. Can we find the range of values for $x$ that satisfy this condition? \n11. How can we find the value of $x$ that produces the maximum length of the sequence? \n12. By considering the given conditions, what is the integer value of $x$ that satisfies the problem?"
