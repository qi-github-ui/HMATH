What values of $x$ do we need to exclude?\n3. After canceling the common factor, what does the equation reduce to? Why?\n4. How did we arrive at the expression $(x-1)^2(x-3)^2 - 1 = 0$? What is the significance of this expression?\n5. How do we proceed from here to find the solutions? What method do we use?\n6. What are the solutions of the equation? Are there any extraneous solutions? Why or why not?\n7. Can you think of any similar equations that can be solved using the same method?"
