    "problem": "Suppose that all four of the numbers \\[3 - 2\\sqrt{2}, \\; -3-2\\sqrt{2}, \\; 1+\\sqrt{7}, \\; 1-\\sqrt{7}\\]are roots of the same nonzero polynomial with rational coefficients. What is the smallest possible degree of the polynomial?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Because the polynomial has rational coefficients, the radical conjugate of each of the given roots must also be roots of the polynomial. However, $1+\\sqrt{7}$ and $1-\\sqrt{7}$ are each other's radical conjugates, so we only get $2$ more roots. (You might be tempted to think that $3-2\\sqrt2$ and $-3-2\\sqrt2$ are also a pair of radical conjugates, but the radical conjugate of $3-2\\sqrt2$ is $3+2\\sqrt2,$ while the radical conjugate of $-3-2\\sqrt2$ is $-3+2\\sqrt2.$ Therefore, each one of the numbers $3-2\\sqrt2$ and $-3-2\\sqrt2$ is actually the negation of the radical conjugate of the other one.) In total, the polynomial must have at least $4+2=6$ roots.\n\nFurthermore, the polynomial\n\\[(x - 3 + 2 \\sqrt{2})(x - 3 - 2 \\sqrt{2})(x + 3 + 2 \\sqrt{2})(x + 3 - 2 \\sqrt{2})(x - 1 - \\sqrt{7})(x - 1 + \\sqrt{7}) = (x^2 - 6x + 1)(x^2 + 6x + 1)(x^2 - 2x - 6)\\]has roots $3 \\pm 2 \\sqrt{2},$ $-3 \\pm 2 \\sqrt{2},$ and $1 \\pm \\sqrt{7},$ and has rational coefficients.  Hence, the smallest possible degree is $\\boxed{6}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the concept of radical conjugates? How do we determine the radical conjugate of a given root?\n2. Why must the polynomial have at least six roots in order to have all four given roots as its roots?\n3. How do we generate a polynomial with given roots? What is the connection between the roots and the factors of the polynomial?\n4. How do we determine the degree of a polynomial? Can a polynomial have more than one degree?\n5. How might we approach this problem if we didn't know the factorization of the polynomial? Can we find the degree of the polynomial without explicitly constructing it? \n6. Are there any other general properties of polynomials with rational coefficients that might help us approach this problem?"
