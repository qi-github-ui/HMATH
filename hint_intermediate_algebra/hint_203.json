    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. What is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and how is it related to this problem?\n3. How did we use Cauchy-Schwarz to derive the inequality?\n4. What value did we obtain from Cauchy-Schwarz and how did we relate it to the expression given in the problem?\n5. How did we determine that the minimum value occurs when $\\frac{x^2}{4} = \\frac{y^2}{9} = \\frac{z^2}{16}$?\n6. Can you explain how we used the given condition $x + y + z = 3$ to find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$?\n7. What are the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that correspond to the minimum value?\n8. Can you think of any similar problems where the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality could be applied to find a minimum value?"
