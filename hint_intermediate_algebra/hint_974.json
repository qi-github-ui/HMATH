    "problem": "Say that an integer $A$ is yummy if there exist several consecutive integers, including $A$, that add up to 2014.  What is the smallest yummy integer?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Here is a sequence of consecutive integers that add up to $2014$:\n$$-2013, -2012, \\dots , -1, 0, 1, \\dots , 2012, 2013, 2014.$$So $-2013$ is yummy.\n\nAssume there is a yummy integer less than $-2013$. Then there is a sequence of consecutive integers (including at least one less than $-2013$) that add up to $2014$. Let $A$ be the least integer in the sequence, so $A < -2013$.\n\nBecause the sum of the sequence is nonnegative, it includes the numbers $A, \\dots, -1, 0, 1, \\dots , -A$.  Because the sum of the sequence is positive, besides the numbers above, it includes $-A + 1$. But $-A + 1 > 2013 + 1 = 2014.$\n\nSo the sum of the sequence exceeds $2014$, which is a contradiction. Hence there is no yummy integer less than $-2013$.\n\nTherefore the least yummy integer is $\\boxed{-2013}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of a yummy integer in this problem? \n2. Can you give an example of a sequence of consecutive integers that adds up to 2014? \n3. Why is it important to find the smallest yummy integer? \n4. How do we know that there is a sequence of consecutive integers that add up to 2014 including any yummy integer? \n5. According to the solution, why is it impossible for there to be a yummy integer less than -2013? \n6. Is it possible to have more than one yummy integer in this problem? Why or why not? \n7. Can this same approach be used to find the smallest yummy integer for other sums besides 2014?"
