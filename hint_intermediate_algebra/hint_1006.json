    "solution": "We rewrite the given recursion as \\[a_ka_{k+1} = a_{k-1}a_k - 3.\\]This implies that the numbers $a_0a_1, a_1a_2, a_2a_3, \\ldots$ form an arithmetic sequence with common difference $-3$. We have $a_0a_1 = 37 \\cdot 72$ and $a_{m-1}a_m = 0$ (because $a_m = 0$). Since those two terms are $m-1$ terms apart, we have \\[a_{m-1}a_m - a_0a_1 = 0 - 37 \\cdot 72 = -3 (m-1),\\]so \\[m = 37 \\cdot 24 + 1 = \\boxed{889}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the given recursion equation in your own words? What does it mean for $a_{k+1}$ in terms of $a_k$ and $a_{k-1}$?\n2. How can we rewrite the recursion equation in terms of $a_k$ and $a_{k+1}$? What does this imply about the sequence of products, $a_ka_{k+1}$?\n3. What does it mean for a sequence of numbers to be an arithmetic sequence? How do we determine the common difference?\n4. How can we relate the arithmetic sequence formed by the products $a_ka_{k+1}$ to the given numbers $a_0a_1$ and $a_{m-1}a_m$?\n5. What does it mean for two terms in an arithmetic sequence to be a certain number of terms apart? How can we use this information to relate $a_0a_1$ and $a_{m-1}a_m$?\n6. Can you find the value of $m$ by solving the equation derived from the previous step? What is the final value of $m$?"
