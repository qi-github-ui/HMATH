    "solution": "We know that $\\omega^3 - 1 = 0,$ which factors as $(\\omega - 1)(\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1) = 0.$  Since $\\omega$ is not real, $\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0.$\n\nThen\n\\[(1 - \\omega + \\omega^2)^4 + (1 + \\omega - \\omega^2)^4 = (-2 \\omega)^4 + (-2 \\omega^2)^4 = 16 \\omega^4 + 16 \\omega^8.\\]Since $\\omega^3 = 1,$ this reduces to $16 \\omega + 16 \\omega^2 = 16(\\omega^2 + \\omega) = \\boxed{-16}.$",
