    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "The given product can be rewritten in the form $(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$, which is the factorization of $a^3-b^3$ for $a=2x^3$ and $b=5y^2$. Therefore, the expression can be rewritten as $a^3-b^3=(2x^3)^3-(5y^2)^3=\\boxed{8x^9-125y^6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you begin simplifying the given expression? What patterns or techniques might you look for?\n2. Can you identify any common factors between the two terms? If so, what would happen if you factored them out?\n3. What is the relationship between $(a-b)$ and the factorization $(a^2+ab+b^2)$? How can you apply this relationship to the given expression?\n4. In the given expression, what is the value of $a$ and what is the value of $b$? How does this relate to the factorization form $(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$?\n5. Using the values of $a$ and $b$ from the previous question, can you express the given expression as a difference of cubes, i.e., $a^3-b^3$? What does this tell you about the factorization?\n6. By using the formula for difference of cubes, what is the simplified form of the given expression?"
