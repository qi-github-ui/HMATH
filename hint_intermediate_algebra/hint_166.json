    "problem": "Find a monic cubic polynomial $P(x)$ with integer coefficients such that\n\\[P(\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1) = 0.\\](A polynomial is monic if its leading coefficient is 1.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x = \\sqrt[3]{2} + 1.$  Then $x - 1 = \\sqrt[3]{2},$ so\n\\[(x - 1)^3 = 2.\\]This simplifies to $x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 3 = 0.$  Thus, we can take $P(x) = \\boxed{x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 3}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the relationship between $x$ and $\\sqrt[3]{2} + 1$ in the given problem?\n2. How can we use the information that $x = \\sqrt[3]{2} + 1$ to find a cubic polynomial that has $x$ as a root?\n3. Why did we square both sides of the equation $(x - 1)^3 = 2$?\n4. Can you explain why the polynomial $x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 3$ has $x = \\sqrt[3]{2} + 1$ as a root?\n5. How do we know that this polynomial has integer coefficients?\n6. Can you think of other ways to find a cubic polynomial with $x = \\sqrt[3]{2} + 1$ as a root?"
