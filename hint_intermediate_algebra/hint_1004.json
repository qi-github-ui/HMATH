    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the given expression represents geometrically?\n2. How can we rewrite the expression in terms of the coordinates of the points A, B, and P?\n3. What is the relationship between the length of AP and the coordinates of point P?\n4. What is the relationship between the length of BP and the coordinates of point P?\n5. How can we use the Triangle Inequality to find a lower bound for AP + BP?\n6. When does equality occur in the Triangle Inequality, and what does that tell us about the position of point P?\n7. What coordinate satisfies both the equation of the line y = x and the line passing through points A and B?\n8. What is the minimum value of AP + BP, and how does this relate to the original problem?"
