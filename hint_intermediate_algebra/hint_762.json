    "problem": "For what positive value of $t$ is $|{-4+ti}| = 2\\sqrt{13}$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $|{-4+ti}| = \\sqrt{(-4)^2 + t^2} = \\sqrt{t^2+16}$, the equation $|{-4+ti}| = 2\\sqrt{13}$ tells us that $\\sqrt{t^2 + 16} = 2\\sqrt{13}$.  Squaring both sides gives $t^2 + 16= 52$, so $t^2= 36$.  Since we want the positive value of $t$, we have $t = \\boxed{6}$.",
