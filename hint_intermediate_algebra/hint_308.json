    "solution": "First, we solve the equation $f(x) = x.$  This becomes\n\\[\\frac{x + 6}{x} = x,\\]so $x + 6 = x^2,$ or $x^2 - x - 6 = (x - 3)(x + 2) = 0.$  Thus, the solutions are $x = 3$ and $x = -2.$\n\nSince $f(x) = x$ for $x = 3$ and $x = -2,$ $f_n(x) = x$ for $x = 3$ and $x = -2,$ for any positive integer $n.$  Furthermore, it is clear that the function $f_n(x)$ will always be of the form\n\\[f_n(x) = \\frac{ax + b}{cx + d},\\]for some constants $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d.$  The equation $f_n(x) = x$ then becomes\n\\[\\frac{ax + b}{cx + d} = x,\\]or $ax + b = x(cx + d).$  This equation is quadratic, and we know it has roots 3 and $-2,$ so there cannot be any more solutions to the equation $f_n(x) = x.$\n\nTherefore, $S = \\{3,-2\\},$ which contains $\\boxed{2}$ elements.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you describe the first step in solving $f(x) = x$?\n2. What other methods, if any, can be used to solve equations like this?\n3. If we choose to solve this equation by setting $f(x) = x$ and simplify, what values can $x$ take?\n4. How can we show that for any positive integer $n$, $f_n(x) = x$ has the same solutions as the original equation $f(x) = x$?\n5. Can you generalize the form of $f_n(x)$ in terms of constants $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$? How does this relate to the solutions of $f_n(x) = x$?\n6. Are there any other types of equations that may require similar thinking and steps to solve?"
