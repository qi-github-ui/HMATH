    "solution": "Since $x$ and $y$ are nonnegative, $x = a^2$ and $y = b^2$ for some nonnegative real numbers $a$ and $b.$  Then\n\\[ab + c |a^2 - b^2| \\ge \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}.\\]If $a = b,$ then both sides reduce to $a^2,$ and so the inequality holds.  Otherwise, without loss of generality, we can assume that $a < b.$  Then the inequality above becomes\n\\[ab + c(b^2 - a^2) \\ge \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}.\\]Then\n\\[c (b^2 - a^2) \\ge \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} - ab = \\frac{a^2 - 2ab + b^2}{2} = \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2},\\]so\n\\[c \\ge \\frac{(b - a)^2}{2(b^2 - a^2)} = \\frac{b - a}{2(b + a)}.\\]We want this inequality to hold for all nonnegative real numbers $a$ and $b$ where $a < b.$\n\nNote that\n\\[\\frac{b - a}{2(b + a)} < \\frac{b + a}{2(b + a)} = \\frac{1}{2}.\\]Furthermore, by letting $a$ approach 0, we can make $\\frac{b + a}{2(b - a)}$ arbitrarily close to $\\frac{1}{2}.$  Hence, the smallest such real number $c$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you define what the question is asking for in your own words?\n2. How can we rewrite the given inequality in terms of nonnegative real numbers $a$ and $b$?\n3. What happens when $a = b$ in the inequality? Does the inequality hold true in this case?\n4. Assuming $a < b$, can you simplify the inequality further using the given expression $ab + c(b^2 - a^2) \\ge \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}$?\n5. What is the interpretation of the expression $\\frac{(b - a)^2}{2(b^2 - a^2)}$ in terms of the original inequality?\n6. Can you explain why $c$ needs to be greater than or equal to $\\frac{(b - a)^2}{2(b^2 - a^2)}$ for the inequality to hold true?\n7. How can we find the smallest positive real number $c$ that satisfies the inequality for all nonnegative real numbers $a$ and $b$ where $a < b$?\n8. Can you propose any values of $a$ and $b$ that test the validity of the inequality?\n9. What is the significance of comparing $\\frac{b - a}{2(b + a)}$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$ in determining the smallest possible value of $c$?\n10. How can we use the limit approach to show that $c = \\frac{1}{2}$ is the smallest positive real number that satisfies the inequality for all nonnegative real numbers $a$ and $b$?"
