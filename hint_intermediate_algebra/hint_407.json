    "solution": "By the Remainder Theorem, $P(19) = 99$ and $P(99) = 19.$\n\nWhen $P(x)$ is divided by $(x - 19)(x - 99),$ the remainder must be of the form $ax + b.$  Thus,\n\\[P(x) = (x - 19)(x - 99) Q(x) + ax + b,\\]for some polynomial $Q(x).$\n\nSetting $x = 19$ and $x = 99,$ we get\n\\begin{align*}\n19a + b &= P(19) = 99, \\\\\n99a + b &= P(99) = 19.\n\\end{align*}Subtracting the equations, we get $80a = -80,$ so $a = -1.$  Then $-19 + b = 99,$ so $b = 118.$  Hence, the remainder is $\\boxed{-x + 118}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the Remainder Theorem is and how it applies to this problem?\n2. How can we determine the form of the remainder when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x-19)(x-99)$?\n3. What can we infer about the degree of the remainder in this case?\n4. How can we use the fact that $P(19)=99$ and $P(99)=19$ to solve for the coefficients of the remainder?\n5. Can you explain why the coefficient of $x$ in the remainder must be $-1$?\n6. How can we use the coefficients we solved for to write the final expression for the remainder?"
