    "problem": "All the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are assigned to the six faces of a cube, one number to each face. For each of the eight vertices of the cube, a product of three numbers is computed, where the three numbers are the numbers assigned to the three faces that include that vertex. What is the greatest possible value of the sum of these eight products?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the labels be $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d,$ $e,$, $f$ be the labels of the cube, so that $a$ and $b$ are opposite, $c$ and $d$ are opposite, and $e$ and $f$ are opposite.  Then the sum of the eight products is\n\\[ace + acf + ade + adf + bce + bcf + bde + bdf = (a + b)(c + d)(e + f).\\]By AM-GM,\n\\[(a + b)(c + d)(e + f) \\le \\left[ \\frac{(a + b) + (c + d) + (e + f)}{3} \\right]^3 = \\left( \\frac{27}{3} \\right)^3 = 729.\\]Equality occurs when $a + b = c + d = e + f = 9,$ which is clearly achievable, so the maximum sum is $\\boxed{729}.$",

How would you compute the product of three numbers for a given vertex?\n4. What is the total number of products that can be computed from the vertices of the cube?\n5. How can we express the sum of all eight products in terms of the labels of the cube?\n6. How can we apply the AM-GM inequality to find the maximum possible value of the sum?\n7. How can we achieve equality in the AM-GM inequality for this problem?\n8. If we change the labels of the cube, how would that affect the maximum value of the sum? Is it possible to achieve the same maximum value with different label assignments?"
