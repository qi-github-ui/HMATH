How do we know that we have achieved equality in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality?\n3. What does the equality condition tell us about the ratio between $a$ and $x$, between $b$ and $y$, and between $c$ and $z$? \n4. Using the equality condition, express $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ in terms of a constant ratio $k$ and $x,$ $y,$ and $z$. \n5. How can we compute the value of the constant ratio $k$?\n6. What is the value of $\\frac{a+b+c}{x+y+z}$ in terms of $k$? \n7. What is the final answer for $\\frac{a+b+c}{x+y+z}$?"
