    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Polynomial long division gives us\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{x} & +2 \\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\n2x+3 & 2x^2&+7x&+10 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{2x^2} & +3x &   \\\\\n\\cline{2-3}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{0} & 4x &  +10 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & 4x &  +6 \\\\\n\\cline{3-4}\n\\multicolumn{2}{r}{} & 0 &  4 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]Hence, we can write\n$$\\frac{2x^2+7x+10}{2x+3} = x + 2 + \\frac{4}{2x+3}.$$So we can see that as $x$ becomes far from $0$, the graph of the function gets closer and closer to the line $\\boxed{y = x+2}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the process of polynomial long division and how is it used to solve the equation?\n2. How did we determine the equation of the oblique asymptote in this case?\n3. Can you explain why the division resulted in a remainder of 4? How does this relate to the graph of the function?\n4. What does the equation of the oblique asymptote tell us about the behavior of the graph as x approaches infinity or negative infinity?\n5. Are there any other methods or techniques that can be used to find the equation of the oblique asymptote?\n6. Can you think of any other rational functions where polynomial long division can be used to find the equation of the oblique asymptote, or is it specific to this function?"
