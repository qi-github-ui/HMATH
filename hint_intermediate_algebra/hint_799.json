    "problem": "Suppose that $(u_n)$ is a sequence of real numbers satisfying\n\\[u_{n+2}=2u_{n+1}+u_n\\]and that $u_3=9$ and $u_6=128$. What is $u_5$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $u_4 = a.$  Then $u_5 = 2u_4 + u_3 = 2a + 9$ and $u_6 = 2u_5 + u_4 = 2(2a + 9) + a = 5a + 18 = 128.$  Solving for $a,$ we find $a = 22,$ so $u_5 = 2 \\cdot 22 + 9 = \\boxed{53}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the given sequence recursion formula in your own words?\n2. What is the significance of $u_3 = 9$ and $u_6 = 128$ in solving for $u_5$?\n3. If we let $u_4 = a$, how can we express $u_5$ in terms of $a$ and $u_3$ using the recursion formula?\n4. How does substituting $a$ for $u_4$ allow us to rewrite the expression for $u_5$ more explicitly?\n5. By substituting $a$ for $u_4$ and using the given values, can you solve for the value of $a$?\n6. Now that we know the value of $u_5$, what conclusions can we draw about the sequence and its pattern?"
