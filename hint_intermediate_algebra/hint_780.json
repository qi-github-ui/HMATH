    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots are all the divisors of 15 (including negative divisors), which are $-15,$ $-5,$ $-3,$ $-1,$ $1,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $15.$  Checking, we find that the only integer roots are $\\boxed{-3,1,5}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step you would take to solve this equation?\n2. How does the Integer Root Theorem help us in finding the possible integer roots of this equation?\n3. What are the divisors of 15 and how do we use them to check for integer roots?\n4. After identifying the potential integer roots, how would you check each possibility to determine if it is a root of the equation?\n5. Can you explain why $-3,$ $1,$ and $5$ are the only integer roots based on the given equation?\n6. Are there any other methods or theorems that could be useful in finding the integer roots of a cubic equation like this one?"
