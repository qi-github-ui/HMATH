    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you state the given functional equation?\n2. What is the explicit formula for $f(x)$ in terms of $f(1)$, as derived from the given equation?\n3. What are the possible values of $f(1)$, and how do they affect the function $f(x)$?\n4. How did we check that the function $f(x) = x + 1$ works?\n5. Are there any other possible functions $f(x)$ that satisfy the given equation, and how can we rule them out?\n6. Can you explain why $n=1$ and $s=3$ for this particular problem?"
