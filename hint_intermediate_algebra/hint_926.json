    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Calculate the magnitudes. $$|t+2i\\sqrt{3}| |6-4i| = \\sqrt{t^2+12} \\cdot \\sqrt{36+16} = \\sqrt{t^2+12} \\cdot \\sqrt{52} = \\sqrt{t^2+12} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{13}$$Set this equal to $26$. $$\\sqrt{t^2+12} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{13} = 26$$Solve for $t$. $$\\sqrt{t^2+12} \\cdot \\sqrt{13} = 13$$$$\\sqrt{t^2+12} = \\sqrt{13}$$We need the positive value, so $t = \\boxed{1}$.",
