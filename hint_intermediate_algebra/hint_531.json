    "problem": "Compute the product of the roots of the equation \\[x^3 - 12x^2 + 48x + 28 = 0.\\]",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is the negation of the constant term divided by the leading ($x^3$) coefficient. Therefore, the answer is \\[\\frac{-28}{1} = \\boxed{-28}.\\]",
