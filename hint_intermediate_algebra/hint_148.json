    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we add 1 to both sides to get $xy + x + y + 1 = 81,$ so\n\\[(x + 1)(y + 1) = 81.\\]The only possibility is then $x + 1 = 27$ and $y + 1 = 3,$ so $x = \\boxed{26}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given equation and what is the goal to achieve?\n2. What is Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick and how is it used to simplify the equation?\n3. Why do we add 1 to both sides of the equation in Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick?\n4. How does factoring of the left-hand side of the simplified equation allow us to solve for the values of x and y?\n5. Are there any other possible factorizations of 81 that would work for x and y? If so, can they be ruled out? If not, why does this factorization work?\n6. How did we use the given condition x>y>0 to eliminate any other potential solutions for the values of x and y?"
