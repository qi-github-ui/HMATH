    "problem": "Real numbers $a$ and $b$ are chosen with $1<a<b$ such that no triangle with positive area has side lengths $1, a,$ and $b$ or $\\tfrac{1}{b}, \\tfrac{1}{a},$ and $1$. What is the smallest possible value of $b$?",

    "solution": "We are told that $1 < a < b.$  We are also told that 1, $a,$ and $b$ cannot form the sides of a triangle, so at least one of the inequalities\n\\begin{align*}\n1 + a &> b, \\\\\n1 + b &> a, \\\\\na + b &> 1\n\\end{align*}does not hold.  We see that $1 + b > b > a$ and $a + b > a > 1,$ so the only inequality that cannot hold is $1 + a > b.$  Hence, we must have $1 + a \\le b.$\n\nAlso, since $1 < a < b,$ $\\frac{1}{b} < \\frac{1}{a} < 1.$  Thus, we must also have\n\\[\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} \\le 1.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{1}{a} \\le 1 - \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{b - 1}{b},\\]so\n\\[a \\ge \\frac{b}{b - 1}.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{b}{b - 1} + 1 \\le a + 1 \\le b,\\]so $b + b - 1 \\le b(b - 1).$  This simplifies to\n\\[b^2 - 3b + 1 \\ge 0.\\]The roots of $b^2 - 3b + 1 = 0$ are\n\\[\\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2},\\]so the solution to $b^2 - 3b + 1 \\ge 0$ is $b \\in \\left( -\\infty, \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right] \\cup \\left[ \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}, \\infty \\right).$\n\nSince $b > 1,$ the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}}.$",
