    "problem": "Find all solutions to the inequality \\[\\frac{x^2}{(x-3)^2} \\ge 0.\\](Give your answer in interval notation.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "As the quotient of two perfect squares, the left-hand side is always nonnegative when it is defined. The left-hand side is defined whenever $x \\neq 3,$ so the solution set is $\\boxed{ (-\\infty, 3) \\cup (3, \\infty) }.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of an inequality and how does it differ from an equation?\n2. Can you explain how to solve inequalities involving fractions?\n3. How do the solutions to an inequality change if both sides are multiplied or divided by a negative number?\n4. What is the general strategy for solving an inequality like $\\frac{x^2}{(x-3)^2} \\ge 0$?\n5. Why is the left-hand side of the inequality always nonnegative when it is defined? What mathematical properties can you use to prove this?\n6. How does the fact that $x$ cannot equal 3 affect the solution set? Why is this important in the context of the problem?\n7. How can you express the solution set of the inequality in interval notation? What does this notation mean and how is it useful in understanding the solution?"
