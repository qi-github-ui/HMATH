    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "The left-hand side, when multiplied out, is a polynomial of degree $6.$ By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is determined by its $x^6$ coefficient and its constant term. The $x^6$ coefficient is $2 \\cdot 5 = 10$ and the constant term is $20 \\cdot 19 = 380,$ so the product of the roots is $\\tfrac{380}{10} = \\boxed{38}.$",
