    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Note that the sum of the elements in the set is 8. Let $x=a+b+c+d$, so $e+f+g+h=8-x$. Then\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(a+b+c+d)^{2} &+ (e+f+g+h)^{2} = x^{2} + (8-x)^{2}\\\\\n&= 2x^{2} - 16x + 64\n= 2(x-4)^{2} + 32\n\\geq 32.\n\\end{align*}The value of 32 can be attained if and only if $x=4$. However, it may be assumed without loss of generality that $a=13$, and no choice of $b,c$, and $d$ gives a total of 4 for $x$. Thus $(x - 4)^2 \\ge 1$, and \\[\n(a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2 = 2(x-4)^2 + 32 \\geq \\boxed{34}.\n\\]A total of 34 can be attained by letting $a,b,c$, and $d$ be distinct elements in the set $\\{-7,-5,2,13\\}$.",

What is the minimum possible value of $(a+b+c+d)^2 + (e+f+g+h)^2$?\n8. Can this minimum value be achieved, and if so, how?\n9. Is there any specific choice of the elements in the set that allows us to achieve the minimum value?\n10. How does the value of the expression change with different choices for $a,b,c,d,e,f,g,$ and $h$?"
