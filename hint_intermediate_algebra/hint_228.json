    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Note that the 8 in the first fraction cancels with the 8 in the second fraction, the 12 in the second fraction cancels with the 12 in the third fraction, and so on.  We are then left with $\\frac{2008}{4} = \\boxed{502}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step in simplifying this product?\n2. How do the numerators and denominators in each fraction relate to each other?\n3.
