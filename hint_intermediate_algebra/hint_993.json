    "problem": "Given that $-1 - 4\\sqrt{2}$ is a root of the equation \\[x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 31 = 0\\]and that $a$ and $b$ are rational numbers, compute $a.$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Because the coefficients of the polynomial are rational, the radical conjugate $-1+4\\sqrt2$ must also be a root of the polynomial. By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of this polynomial is $-31,$ and the product of these two roots is $(-1-4\\sqrt2)(-1+4\\sqrt2) = -31,$ so the remaining root must be $\\frac{-31}{-31} = 1.$ Then by Vieta's formulas again, we have \\[a = -[1 + (-1-4\\sqrt2) + (-1+4\\sqrt2)] = \\boxed{1}.\\]",
