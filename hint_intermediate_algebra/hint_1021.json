    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By AM-GM,\n\\[\\frac{a + b + c}{3} \\ge \\sqrt[3]{abc} = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4.\\]Since $a,$ $b,$ $c$ form an arithmetic series, $\\frac{a + b + c}{3} = b,$ so $b \\ge 4.$\n\nEquality occurs when $a = b = c = 4,$ so the smallest possible value of $b$ is $\\boxed{4}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is an arithmetic sequence and how is it defined? \n2. How can we express the terms of an arithmetic sequence in terms of its first term and common difference? \n3. If the terms of an arithmetic sequence are denoted by $a$, $b$, and $c$, how can we express $b$ in terms of $a$ and $c$? \n4. What is the relationship between the product $abc$ and the terms $a$, $b$, and $c$ in an arithmetic sequence? \n5. Given that $abc = 64$, what is the implication for the product of the terms in an arithmetic sequence? \n6. How can we use AM-GM inequality to find the smallest possible value of $b$ in an arithmetic sequence where $abc=64$? \n7. How do we determine the values of $a$ and $c$ that correspond to the smallest possible value of $b$? \n8. Can this method be generalized to find the smallest term in an arithmetic sequence with a larger number of terms?"
