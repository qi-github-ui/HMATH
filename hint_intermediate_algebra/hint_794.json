    "problem": "The graph of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ has a maximum value of 54, and passes through the points $(-2,0)$ and $(4,0).$  Find $a + b + c.$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the graph passes through the points $(-2,0)$ and $(4,0),$ the equation is of the form $a(x + 2)(x - 4).$\n\nThe graph has a maximum, and this maximum value occurs at the average of $-2$ and 4, namely $x = \\frac{-2 + 4}{2} = 1.$  But $a + b + c$ is exactly the value of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ at $x = 1,$ so $a + b + c = \\boxed{54}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe how you would start solving this problem?\n2. What do you notice about the given points and the form of the equation?\n3. How can you determine the value of $a$ from the graph's maximum value?\n4. Can you explain why the equation is in the form $a(x + 2)(x - 4)$?\n5. How does finding the average of $-2$ and $4$ help us find the $x$-coordinate of the maximum?\n6. What does it mean for $a + b + c$ to be the value of $y$ at $x = 1$?\n7. How does finding $a + b + c$ relate to the original problem?"
