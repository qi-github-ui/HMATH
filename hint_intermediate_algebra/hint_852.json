Therefore, the sum is equal to $\\boxed{500}.$",

How can we use this relationship to simplify the given expression?\n4. What can we observe about the sum of each pair of terms in the given expression?\n5. How many pairs are there in total? What does this tell us about the final sum?\n6. Can you think of any other functions that have a similar relationship between $x$ and $1-x$? How would this affect the sum of their values?"
