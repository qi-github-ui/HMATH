    "solution": "We have that\n\\[3 + \\frac{3 + k}{4} + \\frac{3 + 2k}{4^2} + \\frac{3 + 3k}{4^3} + \\dotsb = 8.\\]Multiplying this equation by 4, we get\n\\[12 + (3 + k) + \\frac{3 + 2k}{4} + \\frac{3 + 3k}{4^2} + \\dotsb = 32.\\]Subtracting these equations, we get\n\\[12 + k + \\frac{k}{4} + \\frac{k}{4^2} + \\frac{k}{4^3} + \\dotsb = 24.\\]Then\n\\[12 + \\frac{k}{1 - 1/4} = 24.\\]Solving for $k,$ we find $k = \\boxed{9}.$",
