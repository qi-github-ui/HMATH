    "solution": "Let the three entries be $\\binom{n}{r},$ $\\binom{n}{r+1},$ and $\\binom{n}{r+2},$ respectively. Then we have \\[\\frac{\\binom{n}{r}}{\\binom{n}{r+1}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\binom{n}{r+1}}{\\binom{n}{r+2}} = \\frac{4}{5}.\\]We simplify the left-hand side of the first equation: \\[\\frac{\\binom{n}{r}}{\\binom{n}{r+1}} = \\frac{\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}}{\\frac{n!}{(r+1)!)(n-r-1)!}} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\cdot \\frac{(r+1)!(n-r-1)!}{n!} = \\frac{r+1}{n-r}.\\]Therefore, $\\frac{r+1}{n-r} = \\frac{3}{4}.$ Similarly, the second equation becomes $\\frac{r+2}{n-r-1} = \\frac{4}{5}.$\n\nCross-multiplying in both equations, we have \\[4r+4 = 3n-3r \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 5r+10 = 4n-4r-4.\\]Solving for $r$ in the first equation gives $r = \\frac{3n-4}{7},$ and then we have \\[9\\left(\\frac{3n-4}{7}\\right) + 14 = 4n,\\]and solving for $n$ gives $n = \\boxed{62}.$",

In which row of Pascal's Triangle do three consecutive entries occur in a specific ratio of 3:4:5?\n4. Let's consider the three entries $\\binom{n}{r}$, $\\binom{n}{r+1}$, and $\\binom{n}{r+2}$ that have the ratio 3:4:5. Can you write down the expressions for these entries using binomial coefficients?\n5. How can we simplify the expressions for each ratio $\\frac{\\binom{n}{r}}{\\binom{n}{r+1}}$ and $\\frac{\\binom{n}{r+1}}{\\binom{n}{r+2}}$?\n6. By cross-multiplying in the simplified expressions, can you show how we arrive at the equations $4r+4 = 3n-3r$ and $5r+10 = 4n-4r-4$?\n7. How can we solve the system of equations to find the value of $n$?\n8. What is the final value of $n$, and which row of Pascal's Triangle does it correspond to?"
