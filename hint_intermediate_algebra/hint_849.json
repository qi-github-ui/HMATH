    "solution": "If $x$ satisfies $x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0,$ then\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 &= 2x + 1, \\\\\nx^3 &= x(2x + 1) = 2x^2 + x = 2(2x + 1) + x = 5x + 2, \\\\\nx^4 &= x(5x + 2) = 5x^2 + 2x = 5(2x + 1) + 2x = 12x + 5.\n\\end{align*}Hence,\n\\begin{align*}\n5 \\alpha^4 + 12 \\beta^3 &= 5(12 \\alpha + 5) + 12 (5 \\beta + 2) \\\\\n&= 60 \\alpha + 25 + 60 \\beta + 24 \\\\\n&= 60 (\\alpha + \\beta) + 49 \\\\\n&= 60 \\cdot 2 + 49 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{169}.\n\\end{align*}",
