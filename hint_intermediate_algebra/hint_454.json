    "problem": "A large candle is $119$ centimeters tall. It is designed to burn down more quickly when it is first lit and more slowly as it approaches its bottom. Specifically, the candle takes $10$ seconds to burn down the first centimeter from the top, $20$ seconds to burn down the second centimeter, and $10k$ seconds to burn down the $k$-th centimeter. (The candle burns down each individual centimeter at a fixed rate.)\n\nSuppose it takes $T$ seconds for the candle to burn down completely. Compute the candle's height in centimeters $\\tfrac{T}{2}$ seconds after it is lit.",

    "solution": "Since the candle is $119$ centimeters tall, the time the candle takes to burn down is \\[T = \\sum_{k=1}^{119} 10k = 10 \\cdot \\frac{119 \\cdot 120}{2} = 71400.\\]We want to compute the height of the candle at time $\\tfrac{T}{2} = 35700$ seconds. Suppose that, at this time, the first $m$ centimeters have burnt down completely, but not the $(m+1)$st centimeter completely. Then we must have \\[\\sum_{k=1}^m 10k \\le 35700 < \\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} 10k\\](the first quantity is the time it takes for the first $m$ centimeters to burn down; the last is the time it takes for the first $(m+1)$ centimeters to burn down). This simplifies to \\[5m(m+1) \\le 35700 < 5(m+1)(m+2).\\]To find $m$, we note that we should have $5m^2 \\approx 35700$, or $m^2 \\approx 7140$, so $m \\approx 85$. Trying values of $m$, we find that when $m=84$, \\[5m(m+1) = 35700\\]exactly. Therefore, at time $\\tfrac{T}{2}$, exactly the first $84$ centimeters have burnt down, and nothing more, so the height of the remaining part of the candle is $119 - 84 = \\boxed{35}$ centimeters.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information about the candle burning rate?\n2. How is the total burn time of the candle calculated?\n3. Can you explain the inequality that relates the time and the burnt centimeters of the candle at $\\tfrac{T}{2}$ seconds?\n4. How is the value of $m$ obtained in terms of the burnt centimeters at $\\tfrac{T}{2}$ seconds?\n5. What is the final answer for the height of the candle at $\\tfrac{T}{2}$ seconds?\n6. If the candle was of a different height or had a different burning rate, what changes, if any, would need to be made to the calculations?"
