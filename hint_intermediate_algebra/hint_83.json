    "solution": "Though it is possible to solve this problem using polynomial long division, it is quicker to use the Factor Theorem.\n\nLet $f(x) = cx^3 + 19x^2 - 3cx + 35$. If $x+7$ is a factor of $f(x)$, the factor theorem tells us that $f(-7) = 0.$  Then\n\\[c(-7)^3 + 19(-7)^2 - 3c(-7) + 35 = 0,\\]which simplifies to $-322c + 966 = 0.$  We can solve for $c$ to get $c = \\boxed{3}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the Factor Theorem and how it is related to finding factors of a polynomial?\n2. What is the relationship between a polynomial and its factors? How can we determine if a given expression is a factor of a polynomial?\n3. How can we use the Factor Theorem to find the constant $c$ when $x+7$ is a factor of $cx^3 + 19x^2 - 3cx + 35$?\n4. What does it mean for $x+7$ to be a factor of the polynomial $cx^3 + 19x^2 - 3cx + 35$? How does this information help us in finding the value of $c$?\n5. Can you explain the steps involved in using the Factor Theorem to solve this problem? What calculations need to be done?\n6. Are there any other methods you can think of to solve this problem? How are they different from using the Factor Theorem?"
