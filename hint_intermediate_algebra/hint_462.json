    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By Factor Theorem, the polynomial will become 0 when $x = -2$ and $x = 1.$  Thus,\n\\begin{align*}\n(-2)^5 - (-2)^4 + (-2)^3 - p(-2)^2 + q(-2) + 4 &= 0, \\\\\n1 - 1 + 1 - p + q + 4 &= 0.\n\\end{align*}Then $-4p - 2q = 52$ and $-p + q = -5.$  Solving, we find $(p,q) = \\boxed{(-7,-12)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the Factor Theorem and how does it apply to this problem?\n2. How can we use the Factor Theorem to find the ordered pair (p,q)?\n3. What are the values of x that make the polynomial divisible by (x + 2) and (x - 1)?\n4. How do we set up equations using the values of x from step 3 to solve for p and q?\n5. By solving the equations from step 4, what is the ordered pair (p,q) that satisfies the conditions?"
