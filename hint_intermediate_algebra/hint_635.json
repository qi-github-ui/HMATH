    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the two given polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, and what does it mean for each of them to have a vertex?\n2. What does it mean for the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of $f$ to be a root of $g$, and vice versa?\n3. What information can we glean from the fact that both $f$ and $g$ have the same minimum value?\n4. Based on the symmetry argument mentioned in the problem, what can we say about the distance between the line $x=100$ and each of the vertices of the parabolas?\n5. How can we express the $x$-coordinates of the two vertices in terms of $a$ and $c$, using the given formulas for the polynomials?\n6. Combining the above insights, what equation can we write relating $a$ and $c$? What does it imply about their sum?\n7. Finally, using the fact that the graphs of $f$ and $g$ intersect at the point $(100,-100)$, can we check that our answer for $a+c$ indeed fits all the given constraints?"
