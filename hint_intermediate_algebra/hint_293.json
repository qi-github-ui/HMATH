    "problem": "If $y=\\frac{12x^4+4x^3+9x^2+5x+3}{3x^4+2x^3+8x^2+3x+1}$, at what value of $y$ will there be a horizontal asymptote?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "For a rational function, if the degree of the polynomial in the numerator is the same as the degree of the polynomial in the denominator, there is a horizontal asymptote at the $y$-value that equals the ratio of the leading coefficient of the numerator to the leading coefficient of the denominator. For this function the $y$-value must equal $\\frac{12}{3}$, or $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the concept of a horizontal asymptote in the context of a rational function? What does it signify?\n2. In this rational function, what are the degrees of the polynomials in the numerator and denominator? How does this relate to the presence of a horizontal asymptote?\n3. What is the leading coefficient of the numerator polynomial? What is the leading coefficient of the denominator polynomial? How are these coefficients relevant to determining the value of the horizontal asymptote?\n4. According to the rule for determining a horizontal asymptote in a rational function, what is the ratio of the leading coefficients in this function? How does this ratio help us find the $y$-value of the horizontal asymptote?\n5. Based on the information you've gathered, what is the $y$-value at which there is a horizontal asymptote for this function? Can you provide the numerical value?\n6. Can you think of any other rational functions where the degree of the numerator polynomial matches the degree of the denominator polynomial? What would be the value of the horizontal asymptote in those cases?"
