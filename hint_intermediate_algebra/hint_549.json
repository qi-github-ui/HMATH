    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get\n\\[(x + 3)^2 + 4(y - 1)^2 = 4.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{(x + 3)^2}{4} + \\frac{(y - 1)^2}{1} = 1,\\]so the semi-major axis is 2, the semi-minor axis is 1, and the area is then $\\boxed{2 \\pi}.$",

What are the coefficients of the squared terms? How can we use these coefficients to determine the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse?\n3. How can we use completing the square in both x and y to rewrite the equation in a more useful form? What is the significance of the constants in this new equation?\n4. How does the new equation allow us to determine the center of the ellipse? How does it help us identify the semi-major and semi-minor axes?\n5. What is the formula for the area of an ellipse? How can we use the semi-major and semi-minor axes to calculate the area?\n6. Are there any limitations or restrictions on using this formula? Are there any assumptions that we need to be aware of?\n7. Applying the formula, what is the area of the ellipse in question? Can you show the steps to arriving at this value?\n8. Can you think of any other equations or situations where a similar thought process and steps might be used to find the area? How might those equations or situations relate to this example?"
