    "solution": "Let $a = \\log_2 x$ and $b = \\log_3 y.$  Since $x > 1$ and $y > 1,$ $a > 0$ and $b > 0.$\n\nBy AM-GM,\n\\begin{align*}\na^4 + b^4 + 8 &= a^4 + b^4 + 4 + 4 \\\\\n&\\ge 4 \\sqrt[4]{(a^4)(b^4)(4)(4)} \\\\\n&= 8ab.\n\\end{align*}Since $a^4 + b^4 + 8 = 8ab,$ we have equality.  Therefore, $a^4 = 4$ and $b^4 = 4.$  Then $a = \\sqrt[4]{4} = \\sqrt{2},$ so\n\\[x = 2^a = 2^{\\sqrt{2}}.\\]Similarly, $b = \\sqrt[4]{4} = \\sqrt{2},$ so\n\\[y = 3^b = 3^{\\sqrt{2}}.\\]Hence, $x^{\\sqrt{2}} + y^{\\sqrt{2}} = 2^2 + 3^2 = \\boxed{13}.$",
