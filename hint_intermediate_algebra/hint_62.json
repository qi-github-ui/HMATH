    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We can arrange the equation as\n\\[9x^3 = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = (x + 1)^3.\\]Taking the cube root of both sides, we get\n\\[x \\sqrt[3]{9} = x + 1.\\]Then $(\\sqrt[3]{9} - 1)x = 1$, so\n\\[x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{9} - 1}.\\]To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt[3]{9^2} + \\sqrt[3]{9} + 1.$  This gives us\n\\[\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{9^2} + \\sqrt[3]{9} + 1}{(\\sqrt[3]{9} - 1)(\\sqrt[3]{9^2} + \\sqrt[3]{9} + 1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{81} + \\sqrt[3]{9} + 1}{8}.\\]Then $a + b + c = 81 + 9 + 8 = \\boxed{98}.$",
