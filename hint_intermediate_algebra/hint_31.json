    "problem": "What is the remainder when $6x^3-15x^2+21x-23$ is divided by $3x-6$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $3x - 6 = 3(x - 2),$ by the Remainder Theorem, we can find the remainder by setting $x = 2.$  Thus, the remainder is\n\\[6 \\cdot 2^3 - 15 \\cdot 2^2 + 21 \\cdot 2 - 23 = \\boxed{7}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the divisor in this problem?\n2. Can you explain what the Remainder Theorem states?\n3. How can we use the Remainder Theorem to find the remainder in this problem?\n4. According to the Remainder Theorem, what value of x should we substitute into the polynomial?\n5. What is the value of the polynomial when x is substituted with 2?\n6. How did you determine the remainder to be 7 in this problem?"
