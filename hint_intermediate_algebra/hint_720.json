    "problem": "The polynomial $ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6$ has a factor of $3x^2 - 2x + 1.$  Find the ordered pair $(a,b).$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We can write\n\\[ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6 = (3x^2 - 2x + 1)(cx^2 + dx + 6).\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[ax^2 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6 = 3cx^4 + (-2c + 3d)x^3 + (c - 2d + 18) x^2 + (d - 12) x + 6.\\]Comparing coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 3c, \\\\\nb &= -2c + 3d, \\\\\n32 &= c - 2d + 18, \\\\\n-16 &= d - 12.\n\\end{align*}Solving, we find $a = 18,$ $b =-24,$ $c = 6,$ and $d = -4,$ so $(a,b) = \\boxed{(18,-24)}.$",
