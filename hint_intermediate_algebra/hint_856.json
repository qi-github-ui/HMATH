    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of a tangent to a circle, and how does it relate to the circle's radius?\n2. How can we use the collinearity of $O$, $A$, and $B$ to simplify our approach to solving this problem?\n3. How can we use the given points $A$, $B$, and $C$ to determine the equation of the circle? \n4. What is the equation of the line passing through $O$ and $T$, and how can we use it to find the coordinates of $T$?\n5. How many points of intersection are there between the circle and the line passing through $O$ and $T$? How can we determine which of these points is the one we want?\n6. What is the Pythagorean theorem, and how can we use it to find the length of $OT$?\n7. Can this method be generalized to find the length of a tangent segment from a point outside any circle to that circle? How?"
