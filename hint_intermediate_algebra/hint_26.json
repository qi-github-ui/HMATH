    "solution": "Write $a = x^2-50x-10$ and $b = x^2+25x+5$.  Then the equation given becomes\n\\[\\frac{a+2b-1}{2} = ab,\\]so $0=2ab-a-2b+1=(a-1)(2b-1)$. Then $a-1=x^2-50x-11=0$ or $2b-1=2x^2+50x+9=0$. The former has a positive root, $x=\\boxed{25 + 2\\sqrt{159}}$, while the latter does not.",

How can we solve the equation $(a-1)(2b-1) = 0$?\n4. What values does $a$ take when $(a-1)(2b-1) = 0$? \n5. Are there any positive real numbers among those values of $a$?\n6. What is the value of $x$ when $a = x^2-50x-11$?"
