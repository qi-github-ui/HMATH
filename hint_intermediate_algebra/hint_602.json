    "solution": "Let $(x,y)$ be a point on the parabola.  The distance from $(x,y)$ to the focus is\n\\[\\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 3)^2}.\\]The distance from $(x,y)$ to the line $3x + 7y - 21 = 0$ is\n\\[\\frac{|3x + 7y - 21|}{\\sqrt{3^2 + 7^2}} = \\frac{|3x + 7y - 21|}{\\sqrt{58}}.\\]By definition of the parabola, these distances are equal.  Hence,\n\n\\[\\sqrt{(x - 3)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = \\frac{|3x + 7y - 21|}{\\sqrt{58}}.\\]Squaring both sides, we get\n\\[(x - 3)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = \\frac{(3x + 7y - 21)^2}{58}.\\]This simplifies to $\\boxed{49x^2 - 42xy + 9y^2 - 222x - 54y + 603 = 0}.$",

Can you explain the reasoning behind this step?\n4. Why did you take the square of both sides of the equation? What does squaring both sides help us achieve?\n5. How did you simplify the equation $(x - 3)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = \\frac{(3x + 7y - 21)^2}{58}$ to obtain the expression $49x^2 - 42xy + 9y^2 - 222x - 54y + 603 = 0$?\n6. Can you verify if the resulting equation satisfies the given requirements: that $a$ is a positive integer, $\\gcd(|a|,|b|,|c|,|d|,|e|,|f|) = 1$, and the equation represents a parabola with the given focus and directrix?\n7.
