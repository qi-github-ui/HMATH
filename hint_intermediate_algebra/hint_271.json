    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given problem asking us to find?\n2. What is the significance of the fact that $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $\\dots,$ $a_{12}$ are positive real numbers?\n3. The solution uses Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. How does the inequality work and why is it applicable in this context?\n4. How did the solution arrive at the lower bound of $\\frac{1}{a_1} + \\frac{1}{a_2} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{a_{12}} \\ge 144$?\n5. When does equality occur in the inequality and what does this result imply about the values of $a_1,a_2,...,a_{12}$?\n6. Can you think of other problems that can be solved using similar techniques or concepts?"
