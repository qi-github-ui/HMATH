    "solution": "Subtracting $3$ from both sides gives \\[\\frac{x}{x-1} + \\frac{x+2}{2x} -3 \\ge 0.\\]Combining all the terms under a common denominator, we get \\[\\frac{x(2x) + (x+2)(x-1) - 3(x-1)(2x)}{(x-1)(2x)} \\ge 0,\\]or \\[\\frac{-3x^2+7x-2}{2x(x-1)} \\ge 0.\\]Factoring the numerator, we get \\[\\frac{-(3x-1)(x-2)}{2x(x-1)} \\ge 0.\\]Making a sign table for the inequality $f(x) = \\frac{(3x-1)(x-2)}{x(x-1)} \\le 0,$ we get:  \\begin{tabular}{c|cccc|c} &$3x-1$ &$x-2$ &$x$ &$x-1$ &$f(x)$ \\\\ \\hline$x<0$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]$0<x<\\frac{1}{3}$ &$-$&$-$&$+$&$-$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$\\frac{1}{3}<x<1$ &$+$&$-$&$+$&$-$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]$1<x<2$ &$+$&$-$&$+$&$+$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$x>2$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]\\end{tabular}Therefore, we have $f(x) < 0$ when $0 < x < \\tfrac13$ or $1 < x <2.$ We also have $f(x) = 0$ when $x = \\tfrac13$ or $x = 2,$ so the whole solution set to the inequality is \\[x \\in \\boxed{(0, \\tfrac13] \\cup (1, 2]}.\\]",
