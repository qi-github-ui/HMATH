    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Set\n\\[y = \\frac{2x + 7}{x - 3}.\\]Solving for $x,$ we find\n\\[x = \\frac{3y + 7}{y - 2}.\\]Thus, for any value of $y,$ we can find a corresponding value of $x,$ except $y = 2.$  Therefore, the range of the function is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,2) \\cup (2,\\infty)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you describe the first step in finding the range of the function $k(x)$?\n2. Are there any restrictions or limitations to consider when finding the range in this case?\n3. Can you explain the process of solving for $x$ in terms of $y$?\n4. Are there any values of $y$ that would result in no corresponding value of $x? If so, what are they?\n5. Based on the solution for $x$ in terms of $y,$ what can we conclude about the range of the function $k(x)$?\n6. Can you think of any other similar functions where we would use a similar thought process and steps to find the range?"
