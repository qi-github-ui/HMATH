    "problem": "Let $z$ be a complex number satisfying $z^2 + z + 1 = 0.$  Compute\n\\[z^{97} + z^{98} + z^{99} + z^{100} + z^{101}.\\]",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $z^2 + z + 1 = 0,$ $(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) = 0.$  This expands as $z^3 - 1 = 0,$ so $z^3 = 1.$  Therefore,\n\\[z^{97} = z^{32 \\cdot 3 + 1} = (z^3)^{32} z = z.\\]Similarly, we can reduce $z^{98},$ $z^{99},$ $z^{100},$ $z^{101},$ to $z^2,$ 1, $z,$ $z^2,$ respectively, so\n\\begin{align*}\nz^{97} + z^{98} + z^{99} + z^{100} + z^{101} &= z + z^2 + 1 + z + z^2 \\\\\n&= (1 + z + z^2) + (1 + z + z^2) - 1 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{-1}.\n\\end{align*}",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. What is the relationship between $z^2 + z + 1 = 0$ and $z^3 = 1$?\n3. How can we simplify $z^{97}, z^{98}, z^{99}, z^{100},$ and $z^{101}$ using the relationship we found?\n4. After simplifying these terms, what do we get?\n5. How can we combine these simplified terms to find the final result?\n6. Can you think of any other equations or problems where similar thinking and steps might be useful?"
