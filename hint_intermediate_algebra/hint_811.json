    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem? What would you do initially?\n2. What inequalities can we apply to the given expression to find the minimum value? \n3. How can we use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in this problem? Can you explain the steps involved?\n4. What conditions must be satisfied for equality to occur in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality? How can we use these conditions to find the minimum value? \n5. What values of $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d,$ $e,$ and $f$ satisfy the given conditions and minimize the expression? How can we verify that these values indeed give the minimum value of $63$? \n6. Are there any other inequalities or techniques that could potentially be used to solve similar problems? How would the thought process and steps involved be similar or different?"
