    "solution": "We have that $z^3 - 1 = 0,$ which factors as $(z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) = 0.$  Since $\\omega$ is not real, $\\omega$ satisfies\n\\[\\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0.\\]By the quadratic formula,\n\\[\\omega = \\frac{-1 \\pm i \\sqrt{3}}{2}.\\]Let $\\omega = \\frac{-1 + i \\sqrt{3}}{2}.$  Then $|a \\omega + b|^2 = 1.$  Also,\n\\begin{align*}\n|a \\omega + b|^2 &= \\left| a \\cdot \\frac{-1 + i \\sqrt{3}}{2} + b \\right|^2 \\\\\n&= \\left| -\\frac{1}{2} a + b + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} ai \\right|^2 \\\\\n&= \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} a + b \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a \\right)^2 \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{4} a^2 - ab + b^2 + \\frac{3}{4} a^2 \\\\\n&= a^2 - ab + b^2.\n\\end{align*}Thus, we want to find integers $a$ and $b$ so that $a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1.$  Note that we derived this equation from the equation\n\\[\\left( -\\frac{1}{2} a + b \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a \\right)^2 = 1.\\]Then\n\\[\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a \\right)^2 \\le 1,\\]so\n\\[\\left| \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a \\right| \\le 1.\\]Then\n\\[|a| \\le \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} < 2,\\]so the only possible values of $a$ are $-1,$ $0,$ and $1.$\n\nIf $a = -1,$ then the equation $a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1$ becomes\n\\[b^2 + b = 0.\\]The solutions are $b = -1$ and $b = 0.$\n\nIf $a = 0,$ then the equation $a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1$ becomes\n\\[b^2 = 1.\\]The solutions are $b = -1$ and $b = 1.$\n\nIf $a = 1,$ then the equation $a^2 - ab + b^2 = 1$ becomes\n\\[b^2 - b = 0.\\]The solutions are $b = 0$ and $b = 1.$\n\nTherefore, the possible pairs $(a,b)$ are $(-1,-1),$ $(-1,0),$ $(0,-1),$ $(0,1),$ $(1,0),$ and $(1,1).$\n\nWe went with the value $\\omega = \\frac{-1 + i \\sqrt{3}}{2}.$  The other possible value of $\\omega$ is\n\\[\\frac{-1 - i \\sqrt{3}}{2} = 1 - \\omega,\\]so any number that can be represented in the form $a \\omega + b$ can also be represented in this form with the other value of $\\omega.$  (In other words, it doesn't which value of $\\omega$ we use.)\n\nHence, there are $\\boxed{6}$ possible pairs $(a,b).$\n\nNote that the complex numbers of the form $a \\omega + b$ form a triangular lattice in the complex plane.  This makes it clear why there are six complex numbers that have absolute value 1.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\nint i, j;\npair Z;\n\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1),red);\ndraw((-3,0)--(3,0));\ndraw((0,-3)--(0,3));\n\nfor (i = -20; i <= 20; ++i) {\nfor (j = -20; j <= 20; ++j) {\n  Z = (i,0) + j*dir(120);\n\tif (abs(Z.x) <= 3.1 && abs(Z.y) <= 3.1) {dot(Z);}\n}}\n[/asy]",
