    "solution": "We can factor by pairing $x^5$ and $-x,$ and $-x^2$ and $-1$:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^5 - x^2 - x - 1 &= (x^5 - x) - (x^2 + 1) \\\\\n&= x(x^4 - 1) - (x^2 + 1) \\\\\n&= x(x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) - (x^2 + 1) \\\\\n&= (x^2 + 1)(x^3 - x - 1).\n\\end{align*}If $x^3 - x - 1$ factors further, then it must have a linear factor, which means it has an integer root.  By the Integer Root Theorem, the only possible integer roots are $\\pm 1,$ and neither of these work, so $x^3 - x - 1$ is irreducible.\n\nThus, $(x^2 + 1)(x^3 - x - 1)$ is the complete factorization.  Evaluating each factor at 2, we get $(2^2 + 1) + (2^3 - 2 - 1) = \\boxed{10}.$",

What methods do you know for factoring polynomials, especially those with monic and integer coefficients?\n3. If we try factoring by grouping, which terms could we pair together?\n4. Why is it not possible to factor $x^3 - x - 1$ further over integers? Are there any integer roots?\n5. How can we determine if a polynomial is irreducible?\n6. If we know that $x^3 - x - 1$ is irreducible, what can we conclude about the factorization of the original expression?\n7. Based on our factorization, what are the individual polynomials $p_1(x), p_2(x), \\dots, p_k(x)$?\n8. What values can we substitute for $x$ in each of the factors to evaluate them?\n9. How can we compute $p_1(2) + p_2(2) + \\dots + p_k(2)$ based on the values we find?\n10. What is the final result of $p_1(2) + p_2(2) + \\dots + p_k(2)$?"
