    "solution": "Setting $y = 1$ in the first equation, we get\n\\[x \\, \\Diamond \\, 1 = x (1 \\, \\Diamond \\, 1) = x.\\]Then from the second equation,\n\\[x \\, \\Diamond \\, x = x \\, \\Diamond \\, 1 = x.\\]Then from the first equation,\n\\[(xy) \\, \\Diamond \\, y=x(y \\, \\Diamond \\, y) = xy.\\]Therefore,\n\\[19 \\, \\Diamond \\, 98 = \\left( \\frac{19}{98} \\cdot 98 \\right) \\, \\Diamond \\, 98 = \\frac{19}{98} \\cdot 98 = \\boxed{19}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of $\\Diamond$ and how is it related to $x$ and $y$?\n2. Can you give an example of two positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ and their corresponding $\\Diamond$ value?\n3. What does it mean for the operation $\\Diamond$ to satisfy the equation $(xy) \\, \\Diamond \\, y=x(y \\, \\Diamond \\, y)$?\n4. How does setting $y=1$ in the first equation help us simplify the expression $x \\, \\Diamond \\, 1$?\n5. How do we use the second equation $(x \\, \\Diamond \\, 1) \\, \\Diamond \\, x = x \\, \\Diamond \\, 1$ to further simplify $x \\, \\Diamond \\, x$?\n6. What can we conclude from the fact that $(xy) \\, \\Diamond \\, y=xy$, and how does this help us find $19 \\, \\Diamond \\, 98$?\n7. What is the value of $19 \\, \\Diamond \\, 98$, and how did we arrive at this answer? \n8. Can you think of any other operations or equations that have similar properties to $\\Diamond$ and the equations provided in the problem?"
