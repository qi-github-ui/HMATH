    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Expanding $(2 - 7i)(a + bi),$ we get\n\\[2a - 7ai + 2bi - 7bi^2 = 2a - 7ai + 2bi + 7b.\\]Since this number is pure imaginary, the real part $2a + 7b$ is equal to 0.  Hence, $\\frac{a}{b} = \\boxed{-\\frac{7}{2}}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What does it mean for a number to be \"pure imaginary\"?\n2. Can you describe the given expression $(2 - 7i)(a + bi)$ in words?\n3. What is the expanded form of $(2 - 7i)(a + bi)$?\n4. How can we determine if a number is pure imaginary based on its expanded form?\n5. What is the real part of the expanded form of $(2 - 7i)(a + bi)$?\n6. How can we use the real part of the expanded form to find $\\frac{a}{b}$?\n7. What is the value of $\\frac{a}{b}$ in this case?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios where we might need to find the real part of a complex expression?"
