    "problem": "The graph of the rational function $\\frac{q(x)}{2x^5+x^4-7x^2+1}$ has a horizontal asymptote. What is the largest possible degree of $q(x)$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "For the given function to have a horizontal asymptote, it can't go to infinity as $x$ goes to infinity. This is only possible if the numerator has the same or smaller degree than the denominator. Since the denominator has degree 5, the largest possible degree of $q(x)$ that will allow the function to have a horizontal asymptote is $\\boxed{5}.$\n\nWe note that 5 is in fact possible, because if we take $q(x) = x^5,$ then the rational function has horizontal asymptote $y = \\frac 12.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of a horizontal asymptote?\n2. How does the degree of the numerator and denominator affect the existence of a horizontal asymptote for a rational function?\n3. What is the degree of the denominator of the given rational function?\n4. What is the largest possible degree that the numerator of the given rational function can have if the function is to have a horizontal asymptote?\n5. Why does having a numerator with a larger degree than the denominator cause the function to not have a horizontal asymptote?\n6. Can you provide an example of a rational function with a horizontal asymptote and a numerator of degree smaller than the denominator? \n7. Can you provide an example of a rational function with a numerator of degree larger than the denominator that does not have a horizontal asymptote? \n8. How does the position of the horizontal asymptote relate to the coefficients of the numerator and denominator of the rational function?"
