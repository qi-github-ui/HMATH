    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of the function $f_n(x)$ in terms of $f_{n-1}(x)$? How is this recursive relationship established?\n2. If $f_{n-1}(x) = \\pm k$, what is the value of $f_n(x)$? How does this help us in understanding the behavior of the function $f_n(x)$?\n3. How does the value of $f_n(x)$ change if $f_{n-1}(x)$ is not equal to $\\pm k$? What does this tell us about the possible solutions to the equation $f_n(x) = 0$?\n4. How can we determine the value of $f_0(x)$ for a given value of $x$? Can we express $f_0(x)$ using mathematical expressions based on the definition of $f_n(x)$?\n5. How does the graph of $y = f_0(x)$ look like? What are the key points or intervals where $f_0(x)$ has a specific value?\n6. What is the significance of the numbers $-100$ and $100$ in the definition of $f_0(x)$? How do they affect the solutions to the equation $f_{100}(x) = 0$?\n7. How many solutions are there to the equation $f_{100}(x) = 0$? Can you explain why based on the properties of the function $f_n(x)$ and the values of $f_0(x)$?"
