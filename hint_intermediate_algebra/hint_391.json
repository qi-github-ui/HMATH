How is the conjugate of a complex number defined and what is its significance?\n4. How can we use the conjugate to calculate the product of a complex number with its conjugate?\n5. How does the formula for $z \\overline{z}$ relate to the absolute value of a complex number?\n6. If $|z| = 5,$ what is the value of $z \\overline{z}$? How did you arrive at your answer?\n7. How can we interpret the value of $z \\overline{z}$ geometrically on an Argand diagram?"
