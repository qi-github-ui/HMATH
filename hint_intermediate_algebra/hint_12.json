    "solution": "This quartic looks almost like a quadratic. We can turn it into one by making the substitution $y = x^2$, giving us $y^2 - 25y + 144 = 0$. We can factor this as $(y - 16)(y - 9) = 0$ to find that $y = 9$ or $y = 16$. We could also have used the quadratic formula to find this.\n\nNow, substituting $x^2$ back for $y$, we see that $x^2 = 9$ or $x^2 = 16$. It follows that the possible values for $x$ are $-3, 3, -4, 4$. Adding all of these values together, we find that the sum of all solutions is $\\boxed{0}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Could you explain the reasoning behind making the substitution $y = x^2$? How does this help simplify the quartic equation?\n2. After making the substitution, we obtain the quadratic equation $y^2 - 25y + 144 = 0$. How did you determine that factoring the quadratic was a possible approach?\n3. What are the solutions for $y$ that you found by factoring the quadratic equation? And how did you ensure that these solutions are correct?\n4. Now we substitute $x^2$ back for $y$. How did you arrive at the possible values of $x$ being $-3, 3, -4, 4$?\n5. Finally, what is the sum of all integer solutions for $x$? How did you arrive at this answer?"
