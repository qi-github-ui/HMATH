    "socratic_questions": "1. To start, can you explain what the problem is asking us to find?\n2. Looking at the long division, what would be the degree of the polynomial $x^2 - 2x + k$?\n3. Why is the first term of the quotient $x^2$?\n4. How do we determine the second term of the quotient?\n5. Why is it important to subtract the product of the divisor and the quotient term chosen from the dividend at each step?\n6. What can we conclude from the fact that the remainder is $(2k - 9)x + (k^2 - 8k + 10)?$ How does this relate to the given information?\n7. How do we determine the values of $k$ and $a$ that satisfy the condition of the remainder being $x + a$?\n8. Can you explain the steps you took to solve for $k$ and $a$?\n9. What is the final result for the ordered pair $(k,a)$?\n10. Can you provide a brief summary of what we have learned from this problem?"
