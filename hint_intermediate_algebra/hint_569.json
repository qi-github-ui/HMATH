    "problem": "What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\\log_2(\\log_3(\\log_4x))$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "In order for the given function to have a real value, $\\log_3(\\log_4x)>0$ (since the logarithm of only any positive number is real). In order for the last inequality to be true, $\\log_4x>1$ (since the logarithm of only any number greater than 1 is greater than 0). The last inequality is true only if $x>4^1$, so $x>4$, or $x \\in \\boxed{(4, \\infty)}$ in interval notation.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what is the definition of a logarithmic function?\n2. How do we determine the domain of a logarithmic function?\n3. What is the composition of logarithmic functions, and how do we simplify them?\n4. Can you walk me through the process of simplifying the given function, $\\log_2(\\log_3(\\log_4x))$?\n5. How do we determine if a logarithmic expression is greater or less than another expression, and how does that relate to the domain of the function?\n6. Can you explain how we can use the concept of inverse functions to determine the domain of the given function?"
