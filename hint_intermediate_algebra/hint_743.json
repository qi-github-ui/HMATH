    "solution": "Note that $A$ is the focus of the parabola $y^2 = 4x,$ and the directrix is $x = -1.$  Then by definition of the parabola, the distance from $P$ to $A$ is equal to the distance from $P$ to the line $x = -1.$  Let $Q$ be the point on $x = -1$ closest to $P,$ and let $R$ be the point on $x = -1$ closest to $B.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.6 cm);\n\nreal upperparab (real x) {\n  return (sqrt(4*x));\n}\n\nreal lowerparab (real x) {\n  return (-sqrt(4*x));\n}\n\npair A, B, P, Q, R;\n\nA = (1,0);\nB = (5,4);\nP = (1.5,upperparab(1.5));\nQ = (-1,upperparab(1.5));\nR = (-1,4);\n\ndraw(A--P--B);\ndraw(graph(upperparab,0,6));\ndraw(graph(lowerparab,0,6));\ndraw((-1,-5)--(-1,5),dashed);\ndraw(P--Q);\ndraw(B--R);\ndraw(B--Q);\n\ndot(\"$A$\", A, S);\ndot(\"$B$\", B, E);\ndot(\"$P$\", P, SE);\ndot(\"$Q$\", Q, W);\ndot(\"$R$\", R, W);\n[/asy]\n\nThen by the triangle inequality,\n\\[AP + BP = QP + BP \\ge BQ.\\]By the Pythagorean Theorem, $BQ = \\sqrt{BR^2 + QR^2} \\ge BR = 6.$\n\nEquality occurs when $P$ coincides with the intersection of line segment $\\overline{BR}$ with the parabola, so the minimum value of $AP + BP$ is $\\boxed{6}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of a parabola, and how is the focus and directrix related to it?\n2. What is the distance from any point on a parabola to its focus and directrix, according to the definition?\n3. How can we find the point on the directrix that is closest to a given point on the parabola, and what is that distance?\n4. How can we find the distance from a given point on the parabola to its focus?\n5. Using the previous ideas, can we express the sum of the distances from a point on the parabola to its focus and a fixed point on the directrix, as the distance between the point on the parabola and the closest point on the directrix that's below the fixed point, plus some fixed length?\n6. What is the significance of the fixed length from the previous question, and how can we geometrically interpret it?\n7. How can we use this geometric interpretation to find the smallest sum of distances from a point on the parabola to the two given points $A$ and $B$, and what is that minimum value?"
