    "problem": "The real numbers $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ satisfy\n\\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 1 = d + \\sqrt{a + b + c - d}.\\]Find $d.$",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x = \\sqrt{a + b + c - d}.$  Then $x^2 = a + b + c - d,$ so $d = a + b + c - x^2,$ and we can write\n\\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 1 = a + b + c - x^2 + x.\\]Then\n\\[a^2 - a + b^2 - b + c^2 - c + x^2 - x + 1 = 0.\\]Completing the square in $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $x,$ we get\n\\[\\left( a - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( b - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( c - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( x - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2 = 0.\\]Hence, $a = b = c = x = \\frac{1}{2},$ so\n\\[d = a + b + c - x^2 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{4}}.\\]",
