    "socratic_questions": "1. What does the equation $f(x) + 2f \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) = 3x$ tell us about the relationship between $f(x)$ and $f \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right)$?\n2. Why is $f(x)$ not defined for $x = 0$? How does this affect our understanding of the function?\n3. How can we obtain an expression for $f(x)$ using the given equation and the substitution $x \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{x}$?\n4. What is the equation $f(x) = f(-x)$ telling us? What does it mean in terms of symmetry about the x-axis?\n5. By substituting $f(x) = \\frac{2 - x^2}{x}$ into the equation $f(x) = f(-x)$, what solution(s) for $x$ do you obtain?\n6. Are these values consistent with the given conditions of the problem? Can you explain why?"
