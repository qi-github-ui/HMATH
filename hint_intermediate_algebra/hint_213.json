    "solution": "By AM-GM,\n\\[\\frac{a}{2b} + \\frac{b}{4c} + \\frac{c}{8a} \\ge 3 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{a}{2b} \\cdot \\frac{b}{4c} \\cdot \\frac{c}{8a}} = 3 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{64}} = \\frac{3}{4}.\\]Equality occurs when $\\frac{a}{2b} = \\frac{b}{4c} = \\frac{c}{8a} = \\frac{1}{4}.$  For example, $a = 1$ and $b = c = 2$ will work, so the minimum value is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.$",
