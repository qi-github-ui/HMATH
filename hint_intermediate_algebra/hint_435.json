    "solution": "Since $x^2 + x + 1$ is a factor of $(x^2 + x + 1)(x - 1) = x^3 - 1,$ and so also a factor of $x(x^3 - 1) = x^4 - x,$ the remainder when $(x^4 - 1)(x^2 - 1)$ is divided by $x^2 + x + 1$ is the same as the remainder of\n\\[(x - 1)(x^2 - 1) = x^3 - x^2 - x + 1.\\]This has the same remainder when $1 - x^2 - x + 1 = -x^2 - x + 2 = -(x^2 + x + 1) + 3$ is divided by $x^2 + x + 1,$ which is $\\boxed{3}.$",
