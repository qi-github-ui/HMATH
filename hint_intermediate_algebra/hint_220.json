    "problem": "Find the quotient when $x^5-23x^3+11x^2-14x+10$ is divided by $x+5$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We use synthetic division.\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rrrrrrr}\n\\multicolumn{1}{r|}{-5} & {1} & 0 & -23 & 11 & -14 & 10 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{1}{r|}{} & & -5& 25& -10 & -5 & 95 \\\\\n\\cline{2-7}\n & 1& -5& 2& 1 & -19& \\multicolumn{1}{|r}{105} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]So we have a quotient of $\\boxed{x^4-5x^3+2x^2+x-19}$ and a remainder of $105$.",
