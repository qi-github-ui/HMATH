    "problem": "Find the center of the hyperbola $4x^2 - 24x - 25y^2 + 250y - 489 = 0.$",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get\n\\[4(x - 3)^2 - 25(y - 5)^2 + 100 = 0.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{(y - 5)^2}{4} - \\frac{(x - 3)^2}{25} = 1,\\]so the center of the hyperbola is $\\boxed{(3,5)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the equation of the given hyperbola?\n2. Can you explain how to complete the square in $x$ and $y$ and rewrite the equation in standard form?\n3. What is the significance of the coefficients in the standard form of the equation of a hyperbola? \n4.
