    "solution": "We know that the graphs of $y = f(x)$ and $y = f^{-1}(x)$ are reflections of each other across the line $y = x.$  If they intersect at some point $(a,b),$ where $a \\neq b,$ then they must also intersect at the point $(b,a),$ which is the reflection of the point $(a,b)$ in the line $y = x.$\n\nBut we are told that the graphs have exactly one point of intersection, so it must be of the form $(a,a).$  Since this point lies on the graph of $y = f(x),$ $a = f(a).$  In other words,\n\\[a = a^3 + 6a^2 + 16a + 28.\\]Then $a^3 + 6a^2 + 15a + 28 = 0,$ which factors as $(a + 4)(a^2 + 2a + 7) = 0.$  The quadratic factor does not have any real roots, so $a = -4.$  The point of intersection is then $\\boxed{(-4,-4)}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for the graphs of $y = f(x)$ and $y = f^{-1}(x)$ to be reflections of each other across the line $y = x$?\n2. Why does a point of intersection between these two graphs imply that there must be another point of intersection at its reflection across the line $y = x$?\n3. How can we determine the coordinates of the point of intersection between $y = f(x)$ and $y = f^{-1}(x)$?\n4. What does it mean for the point $(a,a)$ to lie on the graph of $y = f(x)$?\n5. How can we express this equation algebraically to find the value of $a$?\n6. What are the factors of the equation $a^3 + 6a^2 + 15a + 28 = 0$? \n7. What values of $a$ satisfy the quadratic factor, and are these values real?\n8. What are the coordinates of the point of intersection between $y = f(x)$ and $y = f^{-1}(x)$?"
