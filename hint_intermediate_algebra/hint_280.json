    "solution": "Setting $x = y,$ we get $f(0) = 0.$\n\nSetting $x = -1$ and $y = 0,$ we get\n\\[f(1) = -f(-1),\\]so $f(-1) = -1.$\n\nSetting $y = 1$ and $y = -1,$ we get\n\\begin{align*}\nf(x^2 - 1) &= (x - 1) (f(x) + 1), \\\\\nf(x^2 - 1) &= (x + 1) (f(x) - 1),\n\\end{align*}respectively.  Hence, $(x - 1) (f(x) + 1) = (x + 1) (f(x) - 1),$ which simplifies to $f(x) = x.$  We can check that this function works.  Therefore, $n = 1$ and $s = 2,$ so $n \\times s = \\boxed{2}.$",
