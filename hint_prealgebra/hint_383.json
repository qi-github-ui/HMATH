    "problem": "The stem-and-leaf plot shows the number of minutes and seconds of one ride on each of the $17$ top-rated roller coasters in the world. In the stem-and-leaf plot, $2 \\ 20$ represents $2$ minutes, $20$ seconds, which is the same as $140$ seconds. What is the median of this data set? Express your answer in seconds.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{c|ccccc}\n0&28&28&50&&\\\\\n1&00&02&&&\\\\\n2&20&25&35&43&45\\\\\n3&00&00&00&30&36\\\\\n4&00&00&&&\\\\\n\\end{tabular}",

    "solution": "There are 17 times, so the median time will be the ninth when the times are listed from least time to most time.  Fortunately, the stem-and-leaf plot gives us the times in order.  For example, the first time is 0 minutes and 28 seconds, the second time is also 0 minutes and 28 seconds, and so on.  The ninth time is 2 minutes and 43 seconds.  Converting to seconds gives $2 \\cdot 60 + 43 = \\boxed{163}$ seconds.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is a stem-and-leaf plot, and how does it organize the data?\n2. How can we determine the median from a stem-and-leaf plot?\n3. Why do we need to convert the minutes to seconds before finding the median?\n4. How many data points are there in the stem-and-leaf plot?\n5. Why do we choose the ninth data point to find the median?\n6. How can we convert the time of 2 minutes and 43 seconds to seconds?\n7. Are there any other methods we can use to find the median in this context?\n8. How does finding the median help us understand the data set better?\n9. Can you think of any limitations or assumptions when using the stem-and-leaf plot to find the median?\n10. Can we find any other measures of central tendency, such as the mean or mode, from the stem-and-leaf plot?"
