    "problem": "Lyndy conducted a survey of the 300 students in her school. She found that 60 students own dogs, while only 30 students own cats. What percent of the students own cats?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "30 of the students own cats, and there are 300 students total, which makes for a fraction: $\\frac{30}{300} = \\frac{1}{10} = \\boxed{10\\%}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of students that Lyndy surveyed?\n2. What is the total number of students that own pets in this survey?\n3. What is the difference in the number of students who own dogs and cats?\n4. What information do we need to find the percentage of students that own cats?\n5. How can we convert a fraction to a percentage?\n6. What percentage of students in Lyndy's school own cats based on the given information? \n7. What other pieces of information could help us to find the percentage of students that own cats? \n8. Can you come up with a real-world scenario where knowing the percentage of students that own pets would be useful? \n9. How might you approach finding the percentage ownership for different types of pets (e.g. hamsters, fish, birds) in Lyndy's school?"
