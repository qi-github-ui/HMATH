    "solution": "Because $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the money was spent on movies and there is 30 dollars, the amount of money spent on movies is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 30=10$ dollars. Likewise, $\\frac{3}{10} \\cdot 30=9$ dollars were spent on music and $\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot 30 = 6$ dollars were spent on ice cream. Thus, the total amount of money spent on movies, music, and ice cream is $\\$10+\\$9+\\$6=\\$25$. The remaining amount of money is spent on burgers. Thus, the money spent on burgers is $\\$30-\\$25=\\$\\boxed{5}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What information is given in the problem?\n2. How much money did the person have in total?\n3. What does each section of the pie graph represent? \n4. How can we find the amount of money spent on burgers using the pie graph?\n5. Can we use fractions to represent the portions spent on each item?\n6. How can we calculate the amount spent on each item using the given fractions and the total amount of money?\n7. What is the equation we can use to find the total amount spent?\n8. How can we calculate the amount spent on burgers using the equation and the total amount spent on other items?\n9. Is there any other way to find the amount spent on burgers without using the equation?\n10. Can you think of any other similar problems where pie graphs can be used to find specific amounts?"
