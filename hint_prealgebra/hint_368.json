    "solution": "Only the $8$ corners of the cube have three faces painted red. Each edge has one cube that has $2$ faces painted red. There are $12$ edges, so $12$ cubes have $2$ faces painted red. Each of the six faces has only the center cube painted on exactly $1$ face, and the single cube in the center of the three-inch cube is the only one with no faces painted. We can thus produce the following table: $$\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Number of red faces} & \\textbf{Number of one-inch cubes} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\ast3 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\ast2 & 12 \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 6 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{\n\\text{Total = 27}}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$$\\ast$ Number of cubes with $2$ or $3$ red faces is $8 + 12 = \\boxed{20}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe how the cube was cut into one-inch cubes? How many sub-cubes did it produce?\n2. How many faces did each sub-cube have? How many of those faces were painted red?\n3. How many sub-cubes have exactly three faces painted red? Can you explain why?\n4. How many sub-cubes have exactly two faces painted red? Can you explain why?\n5. How many sub-cubes have only one face painted red? Can you describe their positions?\n6. How many sub-cubes have no faces painted red? Can you describe their positions?\n7. Can you create a table to summarize the number of sub-cubes according to the number of red faces?\n8. How can you calculate the total number of sub-cubes with at least two red faces?\n9. Can you verify that the total number of sub-cubes matches the result obtained in step 8?"
