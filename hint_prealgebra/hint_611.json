    "solution": "Let $s$ equal the side length of square $S.$ Then the area of $S$ is $s^2.$ The longer side of rectangle $R$ will have length $1.1s$ and the shorter side will have length $.9s.$ Thus, the area of rectangle $R$ is: $$1.1s\\cdot.9s=.99s^2.$$ The ratio of the area of rectangle $R$ to the area of square $S$ will be: $$\\frac{.99s^2}{s^2}=\\boxed{\\frac{99}{100}}.$$",
