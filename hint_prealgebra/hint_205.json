    "problem": "Henry walked on a flat field 9 meters due north from a tree. He then turned due east and walked 24 feet. He then turned due south and walked 9 meters plus 32 feet. How many feet away from his original starting point is Henry?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We are dealing in both meters and feet in this problem, which can be confusing. A careful reading, however, reveals that the 9 meters that Henry walked due north are later eliminated by the 9 meters that he walked due south. At the end, Henry is 24 feet east and 32 feet south of his original location. These are the two legs of a right triangle, so we can figure out the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle using the Pythagorean  Theorem. Actually, 24 is $3 \\times 8$ and 32 is $4 \\times 8$, so this is just a multiple of the 3-4-5 triangle. The hypotenuse - and Henry's distance from his starting point must be $5 \\times 8 = \\boxed{40\\text{ feet}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What direction did Henry walk after going 9 meters due north?\n2. After walking 24 feet east, in which direction did Henry turn?\n3. How far did Henry walk after turning due south?\n4. Can you represent Henry's movements as a series of vectors?\n5. How can we determine the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by Henry's movements?\n6. What is the relationship between the lengths of the legs of the right triangle and the length of the hypotenuse?\n7. How can we apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse?\n8. Can we simplify the lengths of the legs in this problem to make it easier to apply the Pythagorean Theorem?\n9. What is the length of the hypotenuse and how does it represent the distance of Henry from his starting point?\n10. Can we solve similar problems using a similar approach involving right triangles and the Pythagorean Theorem?"
