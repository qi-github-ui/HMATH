    "solution": "At the 2007 Math Olympics, Canada won $17$ of $100$ possible medals, or $0.17$ of the possible medals. We convert each of the possible answers to a decimal and see which is closest to $0.17:$ \\[\\frac{1}{4}=0.25 \\quad\n\\frac{1}{5}=0.2 \\quad\n\\frac{1}{6}=0.166666... \\quad\n\\frac{1}{7}=0.142857... \\quad\n\\frac{1}{8}=0.125 \\]The choice that is closest to $0.17$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the problem and what it is asking in your own words?\n2. Why is it important to convert the given fraction to a decimal?\n3. What does it mean for a decimal to be \"closest\" to another decimal?\n4. How would you convert each of the answer choices to decimals?\n5. Which of the decimals is closest to 0.17? How did you determine that?\n6. Can you explain why the answer choice $\\frac{1}{6}$ is the best approximation for the fraction of medals won? "
