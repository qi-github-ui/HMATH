    "problem": "The United States Postal Service charges an extra $\\$0.11$ in postage if the length of an envelope, in inches, divided by its height, in inches, is less than $1.3$ or greater than $2.5.$ For how many of these four envelopes must the extra $\\$0.11$ in postage be paid? \\begin{tabular}[t]{ccc}\nEnvelope & Length in inches & Height in inches\\\\\\hline\nA &6 &4\\\\\nB &9 &3\\\\\nC &6 &6\\\\\nD &11 &4\n\\end{tabular}",

    "solution": "We calculate the desired ratio for each envelope: \\begin{align*}\n\\text{A} &= \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \\\\\n\\text{B} &= \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\\\\n\\text{C} &= \\frac{6}{6} = 1 \\\\\n\\text{D} &= \\frac{11}{4} = 2.75\n\\end{align*} $\\text B,$ $\\text C,$ and $\\text D$ are out of range, so the answer is $\\boxed{3}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the requirement for an envelope to be charged an extra $\\$0.11$ in postage by the United States Postal Service? \n2. Can you calculate the ratio of length to height for each envelope in this problem? \n3. Which envelopes have a ratio that is less than $1.3$ or greater than $2.5$? \n4. How many envelopes must pay the extra $\\$0.11$ in postage according to the given requirements? \n5. Is it possible for an envelope to have a ratio that is exactly $1.3$ or $2.5$? If so, would it be charged the extra $\\$0.11$ in postage? \n6. If an envelope is charged the extra $\\$0.11$ in postage, can we determine its ratio of length to height? \n7. How would the answer change if the requirement for the extra $\\$0.11$ in postage was different? For example, what if the requirement was a ratio less than $1.2$ or greater than $2.8$?"
