    "problem": "A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is the King of $\\diamondsuit$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There is one King of $\\diamondsuit$ and 52 cards total, so the probability that the top card is a King of $\\diamondsuit$ is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{52}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of cards in a standard deck?\n2. How many cards are there for each rank? And how many ranks are there in total?\n3. How many suits are there in the deck? Can you name them?\n4. Are all the suits equally likely to appear on the top card? Why or why not?\n5. What is the probability of drawing a card from the suit $\\diamondsuit$?\n6. What is the probability of drawing the King specifically from the suit $\\diamondsuit$?\n7. Is there any difference in probability if we consider the top card versus any other card in the deck?\n8. Does the arrangement of the deck affect the probability of drawing a specific card?\n9. Can you think of any other similar probability problems where the same reasoning and steps could be applied?\n10. How does your understanding of probability relate to real-life situations?"
