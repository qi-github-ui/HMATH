    "problem": "How many numbers are in the list $ 4, 6, 8, \\ldots, 128, 130 ?$",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Dividing each member of the list by 2, we get $2,3,4,\\ldots,64,65$, and then subtracting 1, we get $1,2,3,\\ldots,63,64$, so there are $\\boxed{64}$ numbers.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. What method could you use to determine the number of numbers in the given list?\n3. If you choose to divide each member of the list by 2, what do you obtain? \n4. What is the purpose of subtracting 1 from the list? How does it help in determining the number of numbers in the list?\n5. Can you explain why there are 64 numbers in the final list after subtracting 1?\n6. Are there other similar types of problems where dividing and subtracting can be used to determine the number of elements?"
