    "solution": "There are 11 small triangles, 4 triangles which consist of four small triangles, and 1 triangle which consists of 9 small triangles.  In total, there are $\\boxed{16}$ triangles.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many small triangles can you count in the figure?\n2. Can you identify any larger triangles formed by combining multiple small triangles? If so, how many are there?\n3. How did you determine the total number of small triangles in each larger triangle? Can you explain your reasoning?\n4. Do you notice any patterns or relationships between the number of small triangles and the size of the larger triangles?\n5. Are there any hidden triangles that we might have missed? How can we be sure that we have found all the triangles?\n6. Can you think of a general formula or strategy that can be applied to count the number of triangles in this figure and similar figures?"
