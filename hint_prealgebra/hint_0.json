    "problem": "Megan has lost Fatima's phone number. Megan knows that the first three digits are either 296 or 299. The remaining four digits are 0, 1, 6 and 7, but she isn't sure of the order of these digits. If Megan randomly dials a seven-digit number that meets these conditions, what is the probability that she dials Fatima's correct number? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 2 different ways in which Megan can type the first three numbers. There are $4! = 24$ different orderings of the digits 0, 1, 6 and 7 for the last four digits. So, there are $2 \\cdot 24 = 48$ different numbers she can dial. Since exactly one number will be Fatima's, there is a $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{48}}$ probability of Megan guessing it right.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many different possible combinations can Megan use for the first three digits of the phone number?\n2. How many different orderings are there for the last four digits of the phone number?\n3. How many total different numbers can Megan dial that meet these conditions?\n4. Why is it important to consider the different ways Megan can type the first three numbers?\n5. Why do we multiply the number of combinations for the first three digits by the number of orderings for the last four digits?\n6. What is the probability that Megan dials Fatima's correct number?\n7. Can you explain why there is exactly one number that will be Fatima's?"
