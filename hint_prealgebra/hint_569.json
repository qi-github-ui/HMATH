    "problem": "What is $(5^{-2})^0 + (5^0)^3$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We know that any number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$, or $a^0 = 1$ for any $a$. Thus, we get $$(5^{-2})^0 + (5^0)^3 = 1 + 1^3 = 1+1 = \\boxed{2}.$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what it means for a number raised to the power of 0 to be equal to 1?\n2. Why do we have $5^{-2}$ raised to the power of 0? What does that mean?\n3. How do we simplify the expression $(5^{-2})^0$ using the rule for exponents?\n4. What is the result when we simplify $(5^0)^3$ using the same rule for exponents?\n5. How can we combine the simplified expressions $(5^{-2})^0$ and $(5^0)^3$ to find the final answer?\n6. Can you think of any other examples where we might encounter expressions involving zero exponents and multiple exponentiations?"
