    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We will begin by finding all the positive factors of $-12$, which are the same as the positive factors of $12$. The positive factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The four numbers we seek must be among these six numbers.\n\nNote that the number $4$ is not a factor of each number on the list, since dividing $114$ by $4$ gives a remainder of $2$. We also know that $12$ cannot be a factor of $114$, since dividing $114$ by $12$ gives a remainder of $6$. However, $6$ is a factor of each number on the list, since   \\begin{align*}\n36 &= 6 \\cdot 6\\\\\n72 &= 6 \\cdot 12\\\\\n-12 &= 6 \\cdot (-2)\\\\\n96 &= 6 \\cdot 16\\\\\n114 &= 6 \\cdot 19\n\\end{align*}Since $1$, $2$, $3$, and $6$ are factors of $6$, and $6$ is a factor of each number on the list, $1$, $2$, $3$, and $6$ must be a factor of each number on the list. So these are the four numbers we were looking for, and our final answer is $$1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = \\boxed{12}.$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step you would take to find the positive factors of each number in the list?\n2. How would you determine if a given number is a factor of another number on the list?\n3. Are there any numbers in the list that cannot be factors of the other numbers? Why or why not?\n4. Based on the given list, which number(s) can be found as factors of each number? Can you explain why?\n5. If we were to find the sum of the four positive integers that are divisors of each number in the list, which numbers would you choose? Why?\n6. Can you think of any other similar problems where finding common factors would be helpful? How would you approach those problems?"
