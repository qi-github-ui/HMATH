    "problem": "A particular convex polygon with seven sides has exactly one right angle. How many diagonals does this seven-sided polygon have?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "For each vertex, we can create a diagonal by connecting it to any non-adjacent vertex. If there are $n$ vertices, there are $n(n-3)$ diagonals we draw. But we are over-counting by a factor of 2 since each diagonal can be created from 2 vertices. So there are $n(n-3)/2$ diagonals. In this problem, since $n=7$, there are $7\\cdot4/2=\\boxed{14}$ diagonals.",
