    "problem": "From point $A$, Leigh walked 40 yards south, 60 yards west, 10 yards north, and 20 yards east to point $B$. What is the length, in yards, of $\\overline{AB}$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Keep up with the north-south movement separately from the east-west movement.  Leigh goes 40 yards south and 10 yards north, so she ends up 30 yards south of her starting position.  She goes 60 yards west and 20 yards east for a net east-west displacement of 40 yards west.  Going 30 yards south and 40 yards west puts Leigh $\\sqrt{30^2+40^2}=\\boxed{50}$ yards away.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you describe Leigh's movement from point A to point B in terms of cardinal directions?\n2. Can you break down Leigh's movement into separate north-south and east-west components?\n3. How far did Leigh move south? How far did she move north?\n4. How would you calculate the net north-south displacement?\n5. How far did Leigh move west? How far did she move east?\n6. How would you calculate the net east-west displacement?\n7. How would you use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between the starting point and the ending point?\n8. What is the length of segment AB in yards, considering both north-south and east-west displacements?"
