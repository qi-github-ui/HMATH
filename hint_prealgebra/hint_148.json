    "problem": "The average of the numbers 23 and $x$ is 27. What is the positive difference between 23 and $x$? (Recall that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2).",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To calculate the average of two numbers, we add them and divide the sum by $2$.  From the given information, we have the equation  \\[\\frac{23+x}{2}=27.\\]  Multiplying both sides by $2$ yields \\[23+x=54.\\]  Thus, $x=54-23=31$.  Finally, the positive difference between $31$ and $23$ is \\[31-23=\\boxed{8}.\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the equation that represents the given problem?\n2. Can you explain what it means for two numbers to have an average?\n3. Using the equation, what is the sum of 23 and x? How did you find this?\n4. How did you isolate the variable x in the equation?\n5. Can you check your solution by plugging in 31 for x? Does it satisfy the original equation?\n6. Is there another method you can think of to solve this problem? How does it compare to the method used above?"
