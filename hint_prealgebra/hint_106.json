    "problem": "The product of two positive integers is 18. The positive difference of these two integers is 3. What is the sum of the two integers?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "18 has 3 possible factorizations into pairs: $(1,18)$, $(2,9)$, and $(3,6)$. Only one of these, $(3,6)$, has difference 3, and it has sum $3+6=\\boxed{9}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information in this problem?\n2. Can you identify any relationships between the product and the difference of the two integers?\n3. How many possible factorizations of 18 into pairs of positive integers are there?\n4. Which of these factorizations satisfy the given condition of a positive difference of 3?\n5. What is the sum of the integers in the factorization that satisfies the condition?\n6. Is there any other way to approach this problem using different methods or strategies?\n7. Can you think of any similar problem where you can apply similar thinking and steps?"
