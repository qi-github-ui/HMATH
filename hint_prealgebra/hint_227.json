What can we conclude about the length of XY based on the angle Z?\n4. Is there any other information or properties of the triangle that can help us find the length of XY?\n5. Can we apply any trigonometric concept or theorem to solve for XY?\n6. How does the length of XY relate to the lengths of the other sides of the triangle?\n7. Can we use any other geometrical concepts or theorems to find the length of XY?\n8. Is there any special relationship between the sides or angles in a right-angled triangle that can help us?"
