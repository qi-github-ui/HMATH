    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $60$ is $60 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$. This means that the odd positive divisors of $60$ are the divisors of $3 \\cdot 5 = 15$ which are $1$, $3$, $5$, and $15$. The sum of these numbers is $1+3+5+15=\\boxed{24}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the prime factors of 60 and how would you determine them?\n2. What are the divisors of 60 and how would you find them?\n3. Which of the divisors of 60 are odd and why?\n4. What is the product of the largest power of 2 that divides 60 and the largest power of 5 that divides 60?\n5. What is the formula to find the sum of divisors of a number and how can it be applied to find the sum of the odd divisors of 60?\n6. What is the sum of the odd divisors of 60 and how can you verify that it is correct? \n7. Can you generalize this process to find the sum of odd divisors of any number?"
