    "problem": "A regular polygon has sides of length 5 units and an exterior angle of 120 degrees. What is the perimeter of the polygon, in units?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If an exterior angle has measure $120$ degrees, an interior angle has measure $60$ degrees.  A regular polygon with $60$ degree angles must be an equilateral triangle, so the perimeter is $3(5)=\\boxed{15}$ units.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what a regular polygon is? What are its defining characteristics?\n2. How can we use the information given about the exterior angle to find the measure of the interior angle in this regular polygon?\n3. What relationship exists between the measure of an interior angle of a regular polygon and the number of sides it has?\n4. How can we determine the number of sides of the regular polygon in this problem using the information given?\n5. Once we know the number of sides, how can we find the perimeter of the polygon?\n6. Are there any other methods or formulas that can also be used to find the perimeter of a regular polygon?"
