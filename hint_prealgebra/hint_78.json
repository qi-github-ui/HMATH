    "problem": "At the end of a game, each of the five members of a basketball team shake hands with each of the five members of the other team, and all of the players shake hands with the two referees. How many handshakes occur?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If we consider the five members of one team shaking hands with each of the five members of the other team, we can simply count the number of hands the members of one team shake, since this will necessarily count all of the handshakes of the other team. Thus, as each of the five people shakes five hands, this gives $5 \\cdot 5 = 25$ handshakes. There are ten basketball players total, and if each shakes hands with two referees, this gives $10 \\cdot 2 = 20$ more handshakes. Thus, a total of $25 + 20 = \\boxed{45}$ handshakes occur.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the scenario described in the problem?\n2. How many members are there in each basketball team?\n3. How many members are there in total, including both teams?\n4. How many handshakes occur between the members of one team and the members of the other team?\n5. Why can we simply count the number of handshakes between the members of one team to determine all the handshakes?\n6. How many handshakes occur when each member of a team shakes hands with each member of the other team?\n7. How many handshakes occur between the players and the referees?\n8. How many handshakes occur in total?\n9. Can you explain the calculations used to determine the number of handshakes between the team members?\n10. Can you explain the calculations used to determine the number of handshakes between the players and the referees?\n11. Can you explain how the total number of handshakes is calculated?"
