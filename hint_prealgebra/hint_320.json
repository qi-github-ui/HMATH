    "problem": "The vertical drop of a roller coaster is the largest difference in height between any high point and the next low point. The vertical drops of five roller coasters at Mandelbrot Amusement Park are shown in the table. \\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \\hline\nThe Parabola & 165 feet \\\\ \\hline\nThe G Force & 119 feet \\\\ \\hline\nThe Mean Streak & 138 feet \\\\ \\hline\nThe Tower of Power & 300 feet \\\\ \\hline\nThe Maximum Ride & 198 feet \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular} What is the positive difference between the mean and the median of these values?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First, we must find the mean and median of the values. In order to find the mean, we sum all the values and divide the result by the number of values: \\begin{align*} \\frac{165+119+138+300+198}{5} &= 184. \\end{align*} in order to find the median, we must first list the values in order from least to greatest: \\[ 119, 138, 165, 198, 300. \\] There are $5$ values, so the median is the middle value, which here is $165.$\n\nSo, the positive difference between the mean and the median is $184-165=\\boxed{19}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the mean of a set of numbers? How do we calculate it?\n2. Can you explain what the median represents in a set of numbers?\n3. Why do we need to list the numbers in order to find the median?\n4. How does the mean provide a measure of central tendency in the data set?\n5. What does the positive difference between the mean and median indicate about the data set?\n6. Can you think of a scenario where the mean and median would be the same? How about different? What impact does this have on the positive difference?\n7. How can understanding the positive difference between the mean and the median help us interpret the roller coaster data?"
