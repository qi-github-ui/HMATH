    "problem": "Two distinct primes, each greater than 20, are multiplied. What is the least possible product of these two primes?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The first two distinct primes greater than 20 are 23 and 29. Therefore, the least possible product is $23\\cdot29=\\boxed{667}$.",
