    "solution": "First, observe that $AC=CD$.  Therefore, triangle $ACD$ is isosceles and $\\angle CAD$ is congruent to $\\angle CDA$.  Also, $m\\angle ACD=m\\angle ACB+m\\angle BCD=60^\\circ+90^\\circ=150^\\circ$.  Since the three angles of triangle $ACD$ sum to 180 degrees, we have  \\begin{align*}\nm\\angle CAD+m\\angle CDA+150^\\circ&=180^\\circ \\implies \\\\\n2m\\angle CAD&=30^\\circ\\implies \\\\\nm\\angle CAD&=\\boxed{15} \\text{ degrees}.\n\\end{align*}",
