    "problem": "At a women's doubles tennis tournament, there were three teams of  two women. After the tournament, each woman shook hands once with each of the other players except her partner. What is the number of handshakes that occurred?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Each of the six women shakes hands with four other women. Multiplying six by four will count each handshake twice, however, so we must divide by 2 to correct for this. The answer is therefore $(6\\cdot 4)/2=\\boxed{12}$.\n\nAll 12 handshakes can be shown visually in the following diagram.\n\n[asy]\nsize(200,135);\n\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA=(20,0);\nB=(20,30);\nC=(180,0);\nD=(180,30);\nE=(85,125);\nF=(115,125);\n\ndot(A);\ndot(B);\ndot(C);\ndot(D);\ndot(E);\ndot(F);\n\ndraw(A--C,red);\ndraw(A--D,red);\ndraw(B--C,red);\ndraw(B--D,red);\ndraw(A--E,blue);\ndraw(A--F,blue);\ndraw(B--E,blue);\ndraw(B--F,blue);\ndraw(C--E,green);\ndraw(C--F,green);\ndraw(D--E,green);\ndraw(D--F,green);\n\nlabel(\"Team 1\",(0,15));\nlabel(\"Team 2\",(200,15));\nlabel(\"Team 3\",(100,135));\n\n[/asy]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the problem in your own words? \n2. How many teams were there in the doubles tennis tournament? \n3. How many women were there in each team? \n4. How many total women participated in the tournament? \n5. How many times did each woman shake hands with someone else? \n6. Was every woman able to shake hands with every other participant except her partner? \n7. Why do we need to divide the total handshakes by 2 in order to get the correct answer? \n8. Can you draw a diagram to represent the handshakes that occurred? \n9. If there were four teams instead of three, how many handshakes would have occurred? \n10. Can you think of any other real-life scenarios where this type of counting problem might arise?"
