    "solution": "We want to find the fraction of people that chose ``Pop\". To this end, we find the fraction of the circle that represents ``Pop\", $\\frac{251}{360}$, and multiply by the total number of people surveyed: $472 \\cdot \\frac{251}{360} \\approx 329.089$. Rounding to a whole number gives a possible answer of $329$ people.\n\nThis method doesn't prove that the answer is unique, but we can check that $328$ people would take up only $\\frac{328}{472}\\cdot 360 \\approx 250.169$ degrees of the pie chart, while $330$ people would take up $\\frac{330}{472}\\cdot 360 \\approx 251.695$ degrees. So, $\\boxed{329}$ people are the only number whose share of the pie rounds to the nearest degree as $251^\\circ$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many people were surveyed in total?\n2. What information does the central angle of the \"Pop\" sector provide?\n3. Can you calculate the fraction of the circle that represents \"Pop\" using the central angle?\n4. What is the formula to find the fraction of a circle given its central angle and the total angle of a circle?\n5. How can we use the fraction calculated in the previous question to find the number of people who chose \"Pop\"?\n6. Is there a need to round the result? Why or why not?\n7. How can we check if the rounded number is correct?\n8. Can you explain how you checked if rounding the result to the nearest whole number gave a possible answer?\n9. Is there any other possible answer that can be obtained by rounding differently?\n10. Why did we use the method of multiplying the fraction by the total number of people surveyed? Are there any alternatives?"
