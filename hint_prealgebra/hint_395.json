At 6:44, the minute hand points at minute 44, which is $\\frac45$ of the way from hour 8 to hour 9.  Therefore, the minute hand is $\\frac45\\cdot 30^\\circ = 24^\\circ$ past hour 8.  The hour hand is $\\frac{44}{60} = \\frac{11}{15}$ of the way from hour 6 to hour 7, so it is $\\frac{11}{15}\\cdot 30^\\circ = 22^\\circ$ past hour 6.  This means that the hour hand is $30^\\circ -22^\\circ = 8^\\circ$ from hour 7.  Since hours 7 and 8 are $30^\\circ$ apart, the total angle between the two hands is $8^\\circ + 30^\\circ + 24^\\circ = \\boxed{62^\\circ}$.",
