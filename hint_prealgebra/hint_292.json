    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the smallest number of people that can be broken up into 15 groups of equal membership and into 48 groups of equal membership.  This means $x$ must be a multiple of both 15 and 48.  The smallest such number is the least common multiple of 15 and 48. $15=3 \\cdot 5$ and $48=2^4 \\cdot 3$. Thus, any multiple of 15 and 48 must have a factor of 2 raised to at least the fourth power, a factor of 3 raised to at least the first power, and a factor of 5 raised to at least the first power. Thus, the least such multiple is $2^4 \\cdot 3\\cdot 5 = \\boxed{240}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you restate the problem using your own words? \n2. How would you go about determining the smallest number that can be broken up into both 15 and 48 groups of equal size? \n3. What is the prime factorization of 15 and 48? How does this help us find the least common multiple? \n4. What is the definition of LCM (least common multiple)? \n5. Can you explain why any multiple of 15 and 48 must have a factor of 2 raised to at least the 4th power, a factor of 3 raised to at least the 1st power, and a factor of 5 raised to at least the 1st power? \n6. How did you use the prime factorization of 15 and 48 to find the least common multiple? \n7. Can you think of any other problems where finding the least common multiple is necessary? \n8. How can understanding LCM help in solving more complex problems in algebra and mathematics?"
