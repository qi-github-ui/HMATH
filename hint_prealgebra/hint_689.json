    "problem": "The area of a rectangle is 432 square centimeters. What would the new area be if the length of the rectangle was decreased by $10\\%$ and the width of the rectangle was increased by $10\\%$? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the length of the rectangle is decreased by $10\\%$, it will be $90\\%$ of what it was. If the width is increased by $10\\%$, it will be $110\\%$ of what it was. The area will be $0.9 \\times 1.1 = 0.99 = 99\\%$ of what it was. Thus, $99\\%$ of 432 is $0.99 \\times 432 = 427.68$ or about $\\boxed{428\\text{ square centimeters}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the area of the rectangle given in the problem statement?\n2. What happens to the length of the rectangle if it is decreased by $10\\%$? \n3.
