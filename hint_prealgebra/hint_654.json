    "solution": "We can add $0.5$ to each member of the list, to make it easier to deal with: $$\n2, 6, 10, 14, \\ldots, 42, 46.\n$$ If we add 2 to each of the terms, we get: $$\n4, 8, 12, 16, \\ldots, 44, 48.\n$$ Now if we divide by 4, we get $$\n1, 2, 3, 4, \\ldots, 11, 12,\n$$ so there are $\\boxed{12}$ numbers in the list.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we make the list easier to deal with? \n2. What happens when we add 2 to each of the terms in the list? Why do we do this? \n3. After adding 2 to each term, what do we get? What does this tell us about the list? \n4. What happens if we divide each term by 4? Can you explain why we choose to divide by 4? \n5. After dividing by 4, what do we get? What does this tell us about the original list? \n6. Based on the transformed list, how many numbers are in the original list?"
