    "problem": "A zoo has a menagerie containing four pairs of different animals, one male and one female for each. The zookeeper wishes to feed the animals in a specific pattern: each time he feeds a single animal, the next one he feeds must be a different gender. If he starts by feeding the male giraffe, how many ways can he feed all the animals?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the zookeeper starts with the male giraffe, there are 4 females which he can feed next. Once one is selected, there are 3 males he can feed next, then 3 females, 2 males, 2 females, 1 male, and 1 female.\n\nThe total number of possibilities is $4\\times3\\times3\\times2\\times2 = \\boxed{144}$ ways.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the specific pattern that the zookeeper wants to follow when feeding the animals?\n2. If the zookeeper starts by feeding the male giraffe, how many females can he feed next?\n3. Once the zookeeper selects a female to feed, how many males can he feed next?\n4. After feeding a male, how many females are left to be fed?\n5. If the zookeeper continues this pattern until all the animals are fed, how many males and females are left to be fed at each step?\n6. How many total ways can the zookeeper feed all the animals if he starts with the male giraffe?"
