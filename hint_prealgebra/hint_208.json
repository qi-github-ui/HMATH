    "problem": "Sandy plans to paint one wall in her bedroom. The wall is 9 feet high and 12 feet long. There is a 2-foot by 4-foot area on that wall that she will not have to paint due to the window. How many square feet will she need to paint?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of the wall including the window is $9\\cdot12=108$ square feet. The area of the window is $2\\cdot4=8$ square feet. Thus, the area Sandy needs to paint is $108-8=\\boxed{100}$ square feet.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the problem to me in your own words?\n2. What are the dimensions of the wall that Sandy plans to paint?\n3. Are there any areas on the wall that Sandy will not need to paint? If so, what are the dimensions of those areas?\n4. How can we find the total area of the wall that Sandy needs to paint?\n5. What is the formula for finding the area of a rectangle? Can we apply this formula to find the area of the wall that Sandy needs to paint?\n6. How can we use the information about the window to find the area of the wall that Sandy needs to paint?\n7. What is the final answer to the problem? Can you explain in your own words what this answer represents? \n8. Are there any practical applications for understanding how to calculate the area of a wall or other flat surface?
