    "problem": "How many distinct arrangements of the letters in the word \"basic'' are there?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let's consider building such an arrangement.  We can choose the first letter in 5 ways.  After we have chosen the first letter, we can choose the second in 4 ways.  Similarly, the third letter then has 3 ways of being chosen, the second letter 2, and the last letter only 1.  Thus the total number of arrangements is $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{120}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the word \"distinct arrangements\" in this context? \n2. How many letters are there in the word \"basic\"? \n3. What is the total number of arrangements if we only consider rearranging all the letters? \n4. Is it possible to form a new arrangement by repeating any of the letters in \"basic\"? \n5. If we wanted to create arrangements with a certain letter in a certain position, how would we approach that? \n6. Can you use a similar logic to find the number of distinct arrangements of a word with repeating letters?"
