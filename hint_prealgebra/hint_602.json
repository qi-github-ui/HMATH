    "problem": "While walking on a plane surface, a traveler first headed 18 miles north, then 11 miles west, then 6 miles south and finally 6 miles east. How many miles from the starting point was the traveler after these four legs of the journey?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "In total, the traveler went 12 miles north and 5 miles west. This forms a 5-12-13 Pythagorean triple, so the traveler is $\\boxed{13}$ miles away from the starting point.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you summarize the traveler's journey in terms of directions and distances?\n2. How can we use Pythagorean triples to help us solve this problem? \n3. What is the Pythagorean theorem and how does it relate to the traveler's journey? \n4. Can you calculate the length of the traveler's displacement vector? \n5. Are there any other methods we could use to solve this problem? \n6. How does the traveler's displacement compare to their total distance traveled? \n7. Can you think of any real-world situations where knowledge of displacement and total distance traveled might be useful?"
