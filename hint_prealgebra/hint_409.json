    "problem": "The areas of two squares are in the ratio $25:36$. What is the ratio of their perimeters? Express your answer in the form $a:b$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "In general, if the ratio of the perimeters of two similar figures is $a/b$, then the ratio of their areas is $(a/b)^2$. So in this case, $(a/b)^2 = 25/36$, or $a/b = 5/6$. So the answer is $\\boxed{5:6}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what is meant by the ratio of perimeters?\n2. What does it mean for two figures to be similar?\n3. How are the perimeters of similar figures related?\n4. Can you think of an example where the ratio of perimeters is different from the ratio of areas?\n5. How can we find the ratio of areas using the given ratio of perimeters?\n6. Can you generalize the relationship between the ratios of perimeters and areas for any similar figures?"
