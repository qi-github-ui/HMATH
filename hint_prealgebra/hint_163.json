    "solution": "Label the feet of the altitudes from $B$ and $C$ as $E$ and $F$ respectively.  Considering right triangles $AEB$ and $DFC$, $AE = \\sqrt{10^2 - 8^2} = \\sqrt{36} = 6\\text{ cm}$, and $FD =\n\\sqrt{17^2-8^2} = \\sqrt{225} = 15\\text{ cm}$.   So the area of $\\triangle AEB$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(6)(8) = 24 \\text{ cm}^2$, and the area  of $\\triangle DFC$ is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) (15)(8) = 60 \\text{ cm}^2$. Rectangle $BCFE$ has area $164 - (24 + 60) = 80 \\text{ cm}^2$. Because $BE = CF = 8$ cm,  it follows that $BC = \\boxed{10\\text{ cm}}$.
