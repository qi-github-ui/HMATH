    "problem": "In a class of $40$ students, $18$ said they liked apple pie, $15$ said they liked chocolate cake, and $12$ said they did not like either. How many students in the class liked both?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Of the $40$ students, $12$ did not like either dessert. Therefore, $40-12=28$ students liked at least one of the desserts. But $18$ students said they liked apple pie, $15$ said they liked chocolate cake, and $18+15=33,$ so $33-28=\\boxed{5}$ students must have liked both of the desserts.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you summarize the problem and what information is given? \n2. How many students in the class are there in total? \n3. How many students said they liked only apple pie? \n4. How many students said they liked only chocolate cake? \n5. How can we use the information we have to determine how many students liked both desserts? \n6. Are there any students who didn't give an answer or whose preferences are unknown? \n7. Can we represent the information with a Venn diagram? If so, how would we label the different regions of the diagram? \n8. How does the fact that there are $40$ total students and $12$ who like neither dessert help us in solving the problem? \n9. Are there any other pieces of information or assumptions that we need to make in order to solve the problem? \n10. How can we check our answer to make sure it makes sense with the information given?"
