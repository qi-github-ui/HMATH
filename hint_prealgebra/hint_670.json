    "solution": "Since $PQR$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, we have $PQ = PR\\sqrt{3} = 9\\sqrt{3}\\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 9\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{27}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you identify the special properties of triangle $PQR$ that can help us find the length of $PQ$?\n2. How can we determine the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle in a 30-60-90 triangle?\n3. What is the relationship between the sides of a 30-60-90 triangle?\n4. Using that relationship, how can we express $PQ$ in terms of another known length in the triangle?\n5. Now that we have expressed $PQ$ in terms of another length, can you calculate its value?\n6. Are there any other types of triangles where we can use similar reasoning to find a side length?"
