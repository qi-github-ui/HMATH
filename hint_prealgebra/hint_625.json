How can we use the fact that the angles around a point sum to $360^\\circ$ to help solve for $x$?\n4. Can we simplify the equation we get from using the fact that the angles around a point sum to $360^\\circ$?\n5. How can we isolate $x$ in the equation we found?\n6. What is the value of $x$ that we solve for using this method? Can we check our answer?"
