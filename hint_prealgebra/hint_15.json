When the two rectangles are positioned to form the T, a two-inch segment of each rectangle is inside the T and is not on the perimeter of the T. So the perimeter of the T is $2(12) - 2(2) = 24\n- 4 = \\boxed{20}$ inches.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the shape of the T created by the two rectangles being placed together? \n2. How do you find the perimeter of a shape, and what information do you need to know in order to do so? \n3. What is the perimeter of each individual rectangle, and how can we use that information to find the perimeter of the T? \n4. When the rectangles are placed together to form the T shape, how many segments are part of the perimeter, and how many are not? \n5. How do we account for the segments that are not part of the perimeter when finding the total perimeter of the T? \n6. Can you come up with a general formula for finding the perimeter of a T shape made up of two rectangles of dimensions $l$ and $w$?"
