    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what perimeter means and how it is calculated?\n2. How many sides does the figure have? What is the length of each side? \n3. How can we find the total length of all the sides of the figure?\n4. Can you explain the steps you would take to find the perimeter of this figure?\n5. Are there any shortcuts or patterns we can use to find the perimeter quickly?\n6. How does the number of sides and the length of each side affect the perimeter of a polygon?\n7. Can you think of any other examples where we can apply the concept of perimeter in a similar way?"
