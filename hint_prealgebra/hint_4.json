    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Recall that division is the same as multiplication by a reciprocal. In other words, if $b$ is nonzero, then $a \\div b = a\\cdot \\frac{1}{b}$. In this case, \\[\n\\frac{2}{5}\\div 3 = \\frac{2}{5}\\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2\\cdot 1}{5\\cdot 3}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{15}}.\n\\]",
