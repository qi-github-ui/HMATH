    "solution": "There are six sections in which the spinner can come to rest, and it is equally likely that it will come to rest in each of the sections. Thus, the probability that it will come to rest in one of the two shaded regions is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",

How many sections are there in which the spinner can come to rest and how likely is it to land in each section? \n3. What is the probability that the spinner will come to rest in either of the shaded regions? \n4. Why is the probability of landing in each section equal? \n5. Can you describe a different scenario in which the spinner could land in one of two equally likely regions? \n6. How would the probability change if the spinner had 4 equally likely sections and 2 were shaded?"
