    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Listing out the first few positive multiples of $4$ and of $14$ shows that $\\boxed{28}$ is the smallest multiple of both $4$ and $14.$ Notice that the least common multiple is not simply $4\\cdot14=56.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what it means for a number to be a multiple of $4$?\n2. What about being a multiple of $14$? How is it related to being a multiple of $4$?\n3. Are there any common multiples of $4$ and $14$ that you know of? Can you list a few examples?\n4. How can we find the smallest positive number that is a multiple of both $4$ and $14$?\n5. Is there a relationship between the multiples of $4$ and $14$ that can help us find the smallest common multiple?\n6. By listing out the first few multiples of $4$ and $14$, can you determine the smallest positive number that satisfies all the given conditions?"
