    "problem": "A square has a diagonal of length $10\\sqrt{2}$ centimeters. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the square?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "A diagonal of a square divides the square into two 45-45-90 right triangles, so the side length of the square is $10\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2}=10$ centimeters and its area is $10^2=\\boxed{100}$ square centimeters",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the relationship between the diagonal of a square and its sides? \n2. How can we use this relationship to find the length of one side of the square? \n3. What is the special property of a 45-45-90 right triangle? \n4. How can we use this property to find the length of the diagonal of the square? \n5. Can you calculate the area of the square given the length of one side? \n6. How does the area of the square relate to the length of its diagonal?"
