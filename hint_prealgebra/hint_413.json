    "problem": "How many perfect squares are two-digit and divisible by $3?$",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Recall that no perfect squares are negative, because squares of all negative numbers are positive and squares of positive numbers are also positive (and $0^2=0$). Since all perfect squares are either $0$ or positive, the only two-digit perfect squares are: \\begin{align*}\n4^2&=16\\\\\n5^2&=25\\\\\n6^2&=36\\\\\n7^2&=49\\\\\n8^2&=64\\\\\n9^2&=81\n\\end{align*} Out of these six perfect squares, only $36$ and $81$ are divisible by $3.$ Note that if a perfect square, $a^2,$ is divisible by $3,$ then $a$ also must have been divisible by $3,$ (as $6$ and $9$ in this case.) Therefore, $\\boxed{2}$ perfect squares are two-digit and divisible by $3.$",
