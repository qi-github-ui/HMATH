    "problem": "The measures of the angles of a triangle are in the ratio 5:6:7. What is the number of degrees in the largest of these angles?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the angle measures are in the ratio $5:6:7$, the measures are $5x$, $6x$, and $7x$ for some value of $x$.  Since these are the angles of a triangle, we have $5x+6x+7x = 180^\\circ$, so $18x = 180^\\circ$ and $x = 10^\\circ$.  Therefore, the largest angle is $7x = \\boxed{70^\\circ}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information about the measures of the angles of the triangle?\n2. How can we use the given ratio to find the measures of the angles?\n3. What is the total sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle? Can we use this information to find $x$?\n4. What is the value of $x$? How did we arrive at this value?\n5. What is the measure of the largest angle in terms of $x$?\n6. What is the measure of the largest angle in degrees?"
