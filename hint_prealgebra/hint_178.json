    "problem": "Sami remembers that the digits in her new three-digit area code contain a 9, 8, and 7, but she can't recall the order. How many possibilities are there for her to try?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 3 ways to choose the first digit, 2 ways to choose the second after the first has been chosen, and 1 way to choose the third after the first two have been chosen, for a total of $3\\cdot2=\\boxed{6}$ possibilities.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you understand the problem and summarize it in your own words?\n2. What are the digits that Sami remembers she needs to use for the area code, and how many of them are there?\n3. What is the total number of digits in Sami's area code?\n4. How many ways can Sami arrange the order of the digits in her area code if she knows which digits she needs to use?\n5. How many ways can Sami arrange the digits in her area code if she doesn't know the order of the digits and needs to try all possibilities?\n6. Can you generalize the formula for finding the number of possible arrangements of n digits taken r at a time?"
