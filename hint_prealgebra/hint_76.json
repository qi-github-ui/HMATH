    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Substituting $c=3$ into the given expression, we find that $\\left(3^3-3(3-1)^3\\right)^3$. We must always begin in the parentheses first, so we calculate $(3-1)^3=2^3=8$. Now our expression is $\\left(3^3-3\\cdot 8\\right)^3$. Carrying out exponentiation first, we find $\\left(27-3\\cdot 8\\right)^3$. Next we do multiplication to get $\\left(27-24\\right)^3$. Finally, we carry out the subtraction last and we find $(3)^3$. Thus, our answer is $\\boxed{27}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step in evaluating the given expression when c = 3?\n2. Can you simplify the expression inside the parentheses before raising it to the power of c? \n3. Why do we need to carry out exponentiation before multiplication and subtraction in this problem? \n4. Can you generalize the steps used to evaluate this expression to other problems involving powers and parentheses? \n5. How can we check our answer to make sure it is correct? \n6. Are there other ways to approach this problem using different algebraic techniques?"
