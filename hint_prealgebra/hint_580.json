    "problem": "Giselle will combine blue paint, green paint, and white paint in the ratio $3:2:4$, respectively. If she uses $12$ quarts of white paint, how many quarts of green paint should she use?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The ratio of white paint to green paint is $4:2$ which simplifies to $2:1$, so Giselle should use twice as much white paint as green paint. Since she uses $12$ quarts of white paint, she should use $12 \\div 2 = \\boxed{6}$ quarts of green paint.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given ratio of blue paint, green paint, and white paint that Giselle will combine?\n2. How can we simplify the ratio of white paint to green paint?\n3. What does a ratio of 4:2 simplify to?\n4. According to the simplified ratio, how much white paint should Giselle use in relation to green paint?\n5. If Giselle uses 12 quarts of white paint, how many quarts of green paint should she use?\n6. Can you think of any other scenarios where ratios are used to determine quantities?"
