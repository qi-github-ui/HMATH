    "problem": "There are 200 students enrolled at Memorial Middle School. Seventy of the students are in band and 95 are in chorus. If only 150 students are in band and/or chorus, how many students are in both band and chorus?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Adding the number of students in the band and the number of students in the chorus gives $70+95 = 165$.  But we are told that there are only 150 students in band and/or chorus, so our 165 must count $165-150 = 15$ students twice, once for the band and once for the chorus.  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{15}$ students in both.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of students in band and chorus combined?\n2. How many students are in band or chorus?\n3. Based on the given information, how many students are in both band and chorus?\n4. Can you explain why we subtracted the total number of students in band and/or chorus from the total number of students in band and chorus combined?\n5. Can you think of any other scenarios where we might need to find the count of students in two overlapping groups?"
