    "solution": "Consider the triangle with angle 4; label the other two angles angle 5 and angle 6. By triangle angle-sum, $m\\angle1+m\\angle2+m\\angle3+m\\angle5+m\\angle6=180^{\\circ}$, or \\[\nm\\angle5+m\\angle6=180^{\\circ}-76^{\\circ}-27^{\\circ}-17^{\\circ}=60^{\\circ}\n\\] By triangle angle-sum on the small triangle, $m\\angle4+m\\angle5+m\\angle6=180^{\\circ}$, so $60^{\\circ}+m\\angle4=180^{\\circ}$ or $m\\angle4=\\boxed{120^{\\circ}}$.",
