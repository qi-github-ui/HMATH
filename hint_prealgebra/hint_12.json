How do you determine the day with the most attendees based on the table provided? \n6. Can the scheduling be rearranged to accommodate more attendees on certain days? If so, how? \n7. If one more person is added to the table on Monday with an X mark, will it affect the day with the most attendees? Why or why not? \n8.
