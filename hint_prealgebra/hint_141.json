    "problem": "Solve for $c$: \\[\\frac{c-23}{2} = \\frac{2c +5}{7}.\\]",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying both sides by 2 and by 7 to eliminate fractions gives  \\[7(c-23) = 2(2c+5).\\] Expanding both sides gives $7c - 161 = 4c + 10$.  Subtracting $4c$ from both sides gives $3c -161= 10$, and adding 161 to both sides gives $3c = 171$.  Finally, dividing by 3 gives $c = \\frac{171}{3} = \\boxed{57}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the first step for solving this equation?\n2. What are some different methods that can be used to solve equations like this?\n3. If you choose to eliminate fractions by multiplying both sides, why do you multiply by 2 and 7? \n4. What is the result after expanding both sides of the equation? How did you simplify it?\n5. After simplifying, what was the coefficient of the variable on one side of the equation? How did you isolate the variable?\n6. What value did you find for \"c\" after solving the equation? How did you determine this value?\n7. Can you think of any other types of equations where similar thinking and steps might be used?"
