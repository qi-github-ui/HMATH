    "problem": "How many positive factors of 96 are also multiples of 12?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We first list the factors of 96 to see which are multiples of 12. The factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, and 96. We see which factors are divisible by 12, because if they are divisible by 12 then they are multiples of 12. We can check them each: 1 is not, 2 is not, 3 is not, 4 is not, 6 is not, 8 is not, 12 is, 16 is not, 24 is, 32 is not, 48 is, and 96 is. So there are $\\boxed{4}$ factors of 96 that are multiples of 12.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you list the factors of 96?\n2. How do you determine whether a factor of 96 is a multiple of 12 or not?\n3. How many factors of 96 are there in total?\n4. Based on the list of factors of 96, how many of them are multiples of 12?\n5. Can you explain why a factor of 96 that is divisible by 12 is also a multiple of 12?\n6. If you were given a different number, how would you approach finding the number of its factors that are also multiples of a given factor?"
