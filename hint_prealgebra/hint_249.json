    "problem": "How many integers between $100$ and $150$ have three different digits in increasing order? One such integer is $129$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We will break up the problem into cases based on the second digit and count the number of integers in each case. If the second digit is 0, there are no integers because the first digit (1) is larger than the second. Similarly, if the second digit is 1, there are no integers. If the second digit is 2, there are 7 integers (with third digit from 3 to 9, inclusive). If the second digit is 3, there are 6 integers (with third digit from 4 to 9, inclusive). If the second digit is 4, there are 5 integers (with third digit from 5 to 9, inclusive). Among all the cases, there are $7+6+5=\\boxed{18}$ integers.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How is the problem broken up into cases based on the second digit?\n2. For each case, how are the different integers counted?\n3. Can you explain why there are no integers if the second digit is 0 or 1?\n4. How many integers are there if the second digit is 2? Can you list them?\n5. How many integers are there if the second digit is 3? Can you list them?\n6. How many integers are there if the second digit is 4? Can you list them?\n7. What is the total number of integers with three different digits in increasing order between 100 and 150?"
