    "problem": "An 8.5-meter ladder is leaning against a vertical wall. How many meters is its base from the wall if the ladder reaches 7.5 meters up the wall?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We have a right triangle where the ratio of one leg to the hypotenuse is $15:17$. Since 8, 15, 17 is a Pythagorean triple, the ratio of the other leg to the hypotenuse must be $8:17$. If the length of this leg is $x$, this means that $x/8.5 = 8/17$. It follows that $x = \\boxed{4}$ meters.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking you to find?\n2. What is the given information?\n3. How can you use the given information to set up a right triangle with the ladder as the hypotenuse?\n4. How can you use the given ratio and the Pythagorean triple to find the length of the other leg of the right triangle?\n5. How can you solve for the length of the other leg using the ratio equation $x/8.5 = 8/17$?\n6. Can you check your answer by verifying that the Pythagorean theorem is satisfied for the right triangle?"
