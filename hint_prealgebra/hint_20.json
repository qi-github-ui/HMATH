    "problem": "How many zeros are at the end of the product 25  $\\times$ 240?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To count the number of zeros at the end of $25\\times240$, we must count the number of products $2\\times5$. We prime factorize the product by combining the prime factorizations of 25 and 240: $25\\times240=(5^2)(2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5)=2^4\\cdot3\\cdot5^3$. We take the minimum of the powers of 2 and 5 to find that $25\\times240$ has $\\boxed{3}$ terminal zeros.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what we are trying to count in this problem?\n2. How do we count the number of zeros at the end of a product?\n3. Can you walk me through how to prime factorize 25 and 240?\n4. How do we combine the prime factorizations of 25 and 240?\n5. What is the minimum power of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of $25\\times240$?\n6. How many terminal zeros does $25\\times240$ have and why? \n7. Can you think of another problem where we would need to count terminal zeros in a product?"
