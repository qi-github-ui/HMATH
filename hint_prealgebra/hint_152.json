    "solution": "There are 15 students, thus, the median is represented by the $8^{th}$ student, who missed 2 days of school.  The mean is calculated by: $\\frac{3 \\times 0 + 1 \\times 1 + 4 \\times 2 + 3 \\times 1 + 4 \\times 1 + 5 \\times 5}{15} = 2\\frac{11}{15}$, making for a difference of $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{15}\\text{ days}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How is the median determined for this data set? How does this represent the number of days missed per student?\n2. How is the mean calculated for this data set? What does the mean represent in terms of the number of days missed per student?\n3. How many students missed 0 days of school? How many missed 1 day? How many missed 2 days?\n4. How many students missed more than 2 days of school? How does this affect the mean?\n5. How does the frequency of students missing 5 days of school affect the mean?\n6. In general, when is the mean greater than the median? How could this concept be applied to other data sets?\n7. Can you think of any potential outliers in this data set that could affect the mean and median? How would that impact the difference between the two values?\n8. How would the mean and median change if we included data for additional students?"
