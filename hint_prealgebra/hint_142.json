    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Prime factorize 315: \\begin{align*}\n315&=5\\cdot63 \\\\\n&= 5\\cdot 9\\cdot7 \\\\\n&= 5\\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7.\n\\end{align*} The distinct prime factors of 315 are 3, 5, and 7, and their sum is $\\boxed{15}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the general process for finding the sum of the distinct prime factors of a given number?\n2. Can you describe the steps you would take to prime factorize 315?\n3. Why is it necessary to find the distinct prime factors instead of considering all the factors of 315?\n4. How do you determine if a number is a prime factor of 315 or not?\n5. Are there any repeated prime factors in the prime factorization of 315? If so, should they be included in the sum or only counted once?\n6. If you added up all the prime factors of 315 without considering repetitions, what would you get? Is this the correct sum of distinct prime factors?\n7. Can you think of any other numbers for which you can find the sum of the distinct prime factors using a similar approach?"
