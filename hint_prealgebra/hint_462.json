    "solution": "We know that the sum of the degree measures of the interior angles of a polygon can be found using the formula $180(n-2)$ where $n$ is the total number of sides of the polygon. Since the polygons in this problem are regular, each interior angle measure can be found by substituting the appropriate $n$ into the formula $\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$. From this, we know that $\\angle DEA$, an interior angle of a regular pentagon, has degree measure $\\frac{180(5-2)}{5}=108 ^{\\circ}$. We also have that $\\angle FEA$, an interior angle of a regular hexagon, has degree measure $\\frac{180(6-2)}{6}=120 ^{\\circ}$.\n\nFinally, we know that the angle measures of $\\angle DEA$, $\\angle FEA$, and $\\angle DEF$ must sum to $360 ^\\circ$, so $\\angle DEF$ has an angle measure of $360 - 108 - 120 = \\boxed{132}$ degrees.",
