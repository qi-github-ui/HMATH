    "solution": "To round to the nearest hundredth, we look at the digit in the thousandth place. 65.141 (A), 65.1401 (D), and 65.14444 (E) all round down to 65.14 since the digit in the thousandth place is less than 5. 65.138 (B) rounds up to 65.14 since the digit in the thousandth place, 8, is greater than 5. 65.1339999 (C) rounds to 65.13, not 65.14. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you define what rounding to the nearest hundredth means?\n2. How do you determine which way to round (up or down) when the digit in the thousandth place is exactly 5?\n3. Can you explain why 65.141 (A), 65.1401 (D), and 65.14444 (E) round down to 65.14?\n4. Why does 65.138 (B) round up to 65.14 despite the digit in the thousandth place being less than 5?\n5. How do you know that 65.1339999 (C) rounds to 65.13, and why does it not round to 65.14?\n6. If you were asked to round to the nearest tenth instead of the nearest hundredth, how would that change your answer choices?"
