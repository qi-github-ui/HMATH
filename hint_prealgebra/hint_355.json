    "problem": "Lucy has $19$ dollars and $23$ cents. She wants to buy as many popsicles as she can with her money. The popsicles are priced at $1$ dollar and $60$ cents each. How many popsicles can she buy?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We can make an inequality with the number of popsicles being the variable $x$.\n$1.60 \\cdot x < 19.23$\nDividing 19.23 by 1.60, we find that the integer part of the quotient is 12. In particular, we have $1.60 \\cdot 12 = 19.2$. So she can buy at most $\\boxed{12}$ popsicles.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the given values in the problem?\n2. What is the value of each popsicle?\n3. What is the total amount of money Lucy has?\n4. How can we represent the number of popsicles she can buy using algebraic notation?\n5. What is the inequality we can write to represent the problem?\n6. How can we solve the inequality to find the maximum number of popsicles she can buy?\n7. How can we verify that the answer we found is correct? \n8. Can we generalize this method to solve similar problems involving different amounts of money and different prices for items?"
