    "solution": "[asy]\nunitsize(1inch);\npair A,B,C,D;\nB = (0,0);\nC = (1,0);\nA = rotate(100)*(0.6,0);\nD = A+C;\ndraw(A--B--C--D--A);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\n[/asy] Because $\\overline{AB}\\parallel\\overline{CD}$, we have $\\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ$.

    "socratic_questions": "1. What property of a parallelogram allows us to conclude that the opposite angles are congruent?\n2. How can we find the measure of angle C if we know the measure of angle B in a parallelogram?\n3. Can you explain why the sum of the measures of angles in a parallelogram is always 360 degrees?\n4. If angle B measures 110 degrees, what does that tell us about angle C?\n5. How can we use the fact that angles B and C are supplementary to find the measure of angle C?\n6. Can you think of any other properties or theorems related to parallelograms that could help us solve this problem?"
