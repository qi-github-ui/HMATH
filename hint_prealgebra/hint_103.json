    "problem": "Six positive integers from a list of nine positive integers are $6, 7, 2, 4, 8, 5$. What is the largest possible value of the median of this list of nine positive integers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If we sort the numbers, we get $2,4,5,6,7,8$. If we want to maximize the median, we should add three numbers larger than 8. This makes the median $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we find the median of a list of numbers?\n2. What is the definition of a median in a list of numbers?\n3. How does sorting the numbers help us in finding the median?\n4. Can you explain the process of sorting the given list of numbers?\n5. Why do we want to maximize the median in this problem?\n6. How many numbers should we add to the given list to maximize the median?\n7. What numbers should we add to the given list to maximize the median?\n8. Can you justify why adding those numbers will result in the maximum median?\n9. Can you explain why the value of the median in this case is the largest possible?\n10. Can you think of any other strategies we could use to find the maximum median in this problem?"
