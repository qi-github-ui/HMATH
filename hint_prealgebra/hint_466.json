    "problem": "On her previous five attempts Sarah had achieved times, in seconds, of 86, 94, 97, 88 and 96, for swimming 50 meters. After her sixth try she brought her median time down to 92 seconds. What was her time, in seconds, for her sixth attempt?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Listing her first 5 times in ascending order, we get  \\[86,88,94,96,97\\] Because the final median is 92 and that is between 88 and 94, the final time must also lie in this spot. Thus, we have \\[86,88,x,94,96,97\\] Because there are an even number of elements, the median is the mean of the center two. Thus, for the mean to be 92, $x$ must be $\\boxed{90}~\\text{seconds}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the previous five times that Sarah achieved for swimming 50 meters?\n2. How can we find the median time from these five previous times?\n3. What is the process of listing the times in ascending order?\n4. How can we determine where the final time should be placed in the ordered list?\n5. What is the significance of the final median being 92 and being between 88 and 94?\n6. How can we calculate the mean of the center two times in the list?\n7. What is the value of the sixth attempt in seconds based on our calculations?\n8. Can you explain why the final time must be 90 seconds based on the given information?"
