    "problem": "Find the product of $0.\\overline{6}$ and 6.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First let's convert $0.\\overline{6}$ to a fraction. Let $p=0.\\overline{6}$ and multiply both sides of this equation by 10 to obtain $10p=6.\\overline{6}$. Subtracting the left-hand sides $10p$ and $p$ as well as the right-hand sides $6.\\overline{6}$ and $0.\\overline{6}$ of these two equations gives $9p=6$, which implies $p=6/9$. We reduce $\\frac{6}{9}$ to $\\frac{2}{3}$ and multiply by 6 to obtain  \\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 = \\frac{2\\cdot 6}{3}=\\boxed{4}.\n\\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the decimal representation of $0.\\overline{6}$?\n2. How can we convert a repeating decimal to a fraction?\n3. Can you explain why multiplying both sides of the equation $p=0.\\overline{6}$ by 10 helps us to convert the repeating decimal to a fraction?\n4. What is the value of $10p$ and $6.\\overline{6}$ after multiplying both sides of the equation $p=0.\\overline{6}$ by 10?\n5. How can we solve for $p$ after subtracting the left-hand sides and right-hand sides of the equations $10p=6.\\overline{6}$ and $p=0.\\overline{6}$?\n6. What is the simplified fraction form of $p$ after solving for $p$ in the equation $9p=6$?\n7. How can we use the fraction form of $0.\\overline{6}$ to find the product of $0.\\overline{6}$ and 6?\n8. What is the product of $\\frac{2}{3}$ and 6?\n9. Can you think of another example where we need to convert a decimal to a fraction in order to solve a problem?"
