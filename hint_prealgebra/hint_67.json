    "problem": "Of the 50 students in the drama club, 36 take mathematics, 27 take physics and 20 students take both mathematics and physics. How many drama club students take neither mathematics nor physics?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Of the 36 taking math, there are 20 taking both math and physics, so there are $36-20= 16$ students taking only math.  Similarly, there are $27-20= 7$ taking only physics.  There are 50 students total, 16 in just math, 7 in just physics, and 20 in both math and physics, so there are  $50-16-7-20= \\boxed{7}$ students taking neither.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of students in the drama club?\n2. How many students are taking mathematics in the drama club?\n3. What is the number of students taking physics in the drama club?\n4. How many students are taking both mathematics and physics in the drama club?\n5. Using the given information, how can we determine the number of students taking neither mathematics nor physics?\n6. What is the number of students taking only mathematics in the drama club?\n7. What is the number of students taking only physics in the drama club?\n8. Using the above information, can you confirm the number of students taking neither mathematics nor physics obtained in question 5?"
