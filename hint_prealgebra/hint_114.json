    "problem": "A number is called a visible factor number if it is divisible by each of its non-zero digits. For example, 102 is divisible by 1 and 2, so it is a visible factor number. How many visible factor numbers are there from 100 through 150, inclusive?",

    "solution": "To begin with, note that all the numbers in question have a 1 in the hundreds place, and every number is divisible by 1, so we do not need to check it.  So we need to see under what circumstances the number is divisible by its tens and units digits.\n\nLet the three-digit number be $\\overline{1TU}.$  We can then divide into cases, based on the digit $T.$\n\nCase 1: $T = 0$.\n\nWe are looking for three-digit numbers of the form $\\overline{10U}$ that are divisible by $U,$ or where $U = 0.$  If $\\overline{10U}$ is divisible by $U,$ then 100 is divisible by $U.$   Thus, the possible values of $U$ are 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n\nCase 2: $T = 1$.\n\nWe are looking for three-digit numbers of the form $\\overline{11U}$ that are divisible by $U,$ or where $U = 0.$  If $\\overline{11U}$ is divisible by $U,$ then 110 is divisible by $U.$   Thus, the possible values of $U$ are 0, 1, 2, and 5.\n\nCase 3: $T = 2$.\n\nWe are looking for three-digit numbers of the form $\\overline{12U}$ that are divisible by $U,$ or where $U = 0.$  If $\\overline{12U}$ is divisible by $U,$ then 120 is divisible by $U.$   Also, $\\overline{12U}$ must be divisible by 2, which means $U$ is even.  Thus, the possible values of $U$ are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n\nCase 4: $T = 3$.\n\nWe are looking for three-digit numbers of the form $\\overline{13U}$ that are divisible by $U,$ or where $U = 0.$  If $\\overline{13U}$ is divisible by $U,$ then 130 is divisible by $U.$   Also, $\\overline{13U}$ must be divisible by 3.  Thus, the possible values of $U$ are 2 and 5.\n\nCase 5: $T = 4$.\n\nWe are looking for three-digit numbers of the form $\\overline{14U}$ that are divisible by $U,$ or where $U = 0.$  If $\\overline{14U}$ is divisible by $U,$ then 140 is divisible by $U.$   Also, $\\overline{14U}$ must be divisible by 4.  Thus, the possible values of $U$ are 0 and 4.\n\nCase 6: $T = 5$.\n\nSince the three-digit number must be between 100 and 150, the only number in this case is 150.\n\nAdding up the possibilities gives us $\\boxed{19}$ possible three-digit numbers.\n\n$\\begin{matrix}\n100 & 101 & 102 & & 104 & 105 \\\\\n110 & 111 & 112 & & & 115 \\\\\n120 & & 122 & & 124 & & 126 & & 128 \\\\\n& & 132 & & & 135 \\\\\n140 & & & & 144 \\\\\n150\n\\end{matrix}$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a visible factor number is based on the given definition?\n2. Can you think of an example of a visible factor number and explain why it fits the definition?\n3. What is the range of numbers we need to consider for this problem? Can you list all the three-digit numbers in that range?\n4. Let's focus on the numbers with \"1\" as the hundreds digit (case 1). Can you think of a rule that helps us determine if a number with the form \"1TU\" is divisible by its tens and units digits?\n5. Based on the rule you described in the previous question, what are the possible values for T and U in case 1?\n6. Can you repeat the process for the other cases (2-6) and find the possible values for T and U in each case?\n7. How many numbers did you find in each case?\n8. Can you add up all the numbers you found in each case to find the total number of visible factor numbers?"
