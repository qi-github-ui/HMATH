    "problem": "Fiona is people-watching again. She spies a group of ten high schoolers and starts playing a game by herself, in which she looks at a pair of people from the group of ten and tries to guess whether they like or dislike each other. How many pairs of friends can she observe before she runs out of pairs to evaluate?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are $10$ options for the first person and $9$ options left for the second person for a preliminary count of $10 \\cdot 9 = 90$ pairs. However, the order in which Fiona chooses the people doesn't matter, and we've counted each pair twice, which means our final answer is $\\dfrac{10\\cdot9}{2}=\\boxed{45}$ pairs of friends.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem presented in this scenario?\n2. What is the initial count of pairs of people that Fiona can observe? Why is it calculated this way?\n3. Why do we need to divide the initial count of pairs by 2? What does this represent?\n4. Can you think of other situations where we need to consider combinations and not permutations? \n5. What would happen if there were 11 people in the group instead of 10? How would this change our answer? \n6. How does understanding combinations help us solve problems in math and in real life?"
