    "solution": "The altitude of an isosceles triangle splits the base into two congruent segments, so $BD = DC = 7$.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to $\\triangle ABD$, or remembering the 7-24-25 Pythagorean triple, gives $AD = 24$, so the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $(24)(14)/2 = \\boxed{168}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the given information about the isosceles triangle $ABC$ in your own words?\n2. What type of triangle is $ABC$, and how do you know? \n3. What is the altitude of the triangle, and what does it do to the base $BC$? \n4. How is the base $BC$ divided by the altitude $AD$, and what does this tell us about the side lengths? \n5. Can you use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $AD$? Why or why not? \n6. How do you calculate the area of a triangle, and what is the formula you can use? \n7. Using the information you have gathered about the triangle and the formulas you know, can you calculate the area of triangle $ABC$?"
