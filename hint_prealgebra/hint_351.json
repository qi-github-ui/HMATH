    "problem": "My three friends and I have dinner together every weekend. Each weekend, two of us cook and the other two clean up afterwards. How many different ways are there for us to choose who cooks and who cleans?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are four ways to choose the first cook and three ways to choose the second cook, but this counts every pair of cooks twice since order doesn't matter. Once the cooks are chosen, the two people left over are the cleaners. So, there are $(4\\cdot 3)/2=\\boxed{6}$ ways for us to choose who cooks and who cleans.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many people are involved in the dinner arrangement?\n2. How many people cook during each dinner?\n3. How many people clean up after each dinner?\n4. How many ways can we choose the first cook from the group of friends?\n5. How many ways can we choose the second cook from the remaining friends?\n6. Why is the order of choosing the cooks not important?\n7. How many ways can we choose the group of cleaners after the cooks are chosen?\n8. How do we account for the fact that order doesn't matter in choosing the cooks?\n9. What is the formula or concept used to calculate the number of combinations in this situation?\n10. Can you explain the calculation $(4\\cdot 3)/2$ and why it gives us the total number of ways to choose who cooks and who cleans?"
