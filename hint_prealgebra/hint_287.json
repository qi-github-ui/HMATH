    "solution": "The sum of the angle measures of a hexagon is $180(6-2) = 720$ degrees, so each angle of a regular hexagon measures $720^\\circ/6=120^\\circ$.  Therefore, $\\angle BAF = 120^\\circ$, which means $\\angle FAP = 180^\\circ - \\angle BAF = 60^\\circ$.  Similarly, $\\angle PFA = 60^\\circ$.  Since the angles of $\\triangle APF$ sum to $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle APF = 180^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 60^\\circ = \\boxed{60^\\circ}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.6inch);\npair A,B,C,D,EE,F,P;\n\nA = (1,0);\nB = rotate(60)*A;\nC=rotate(60)*B;\nD = rotate(60)*C;\nEE = rotate(60)*D;\nF = rotate(60)*EE;\n\nP = A + (A - B);\ndraw (A--B--C--D--EE--F--A--P--F,linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,W);\nlabel(\"$E$\",EE,S);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,S);\n[/asy]",

If each angle of a regular hexagon measures 120 degrees, what can you conclude about angle BAF?\n4. What does it mean for angles FAP and PFA to be equal? How did you determine their measure?\n5. How can we find the measure of angle APF using the information we have about the other angles in the triangle?\n6. Can you think of any other examples or situations where knowing the angle measures of regular polygons would be useful?"
