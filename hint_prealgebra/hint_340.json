    "problem": "A teacher finds that when she offers candy to her class of 30 students, the mean number of pieces taken by each student is 5. If every student takes some candy, what is the greatest number of pieces one student could have taken?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since there are 30 students and a mean of 5 candies per student, there are a total of $5 \\cdot 30 = 150$ pieces of candy. Since every student must take at least one piece of candy, the first 29 students must take a total of at least 29 pieces. Since $150 - 29 = 121$, the greatest number of pieces one student can take is $\\boxed{121}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information in the problem?\n2. How many students are there in the class?\n3. What is the mean number of candies taken by each student?\n4. How can we find the total number of pieces of candy?\n5. Why must every student take at least one piece of candy?\n6. How can we calculate the minimum number of pieces taken by the first 29 students?\n7. How can we determine the maximum number of pieces taken by one student?\n8. Can you explain the reasoning behind subtracting the minimum from the total number of candies?\n9. Is there any other way to approach this problem using critical thinking skills?\n10. Can you think of a similar concept or scenario where mean and total value are involved?"
