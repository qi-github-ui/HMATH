    "solution": "The denominators 6 and 10 have a common multiple of 30. We write $\\frac{9}{10}\\cdot\\frac{3}{3}=\\frac{27}{30}$ and $\\frac{5}{6}\\cdot\\frac{5}{5}=\\frac{25}{30},$ so we can add \\[\n\\frac{27}{30}+\\frac{25}{30} = \\frac{52}{30}.\n\\]The numerator ($52$) and denominator ($30$) have a common factor of $2$, so we can simplify. \\[\n\\frac{52}{30} = \\frac{26 \\cdot \\cancel{2}}{15 \\cdot \\cancel{2}} = \\boxed{\\frac{26}{15}}.\n\\]",
