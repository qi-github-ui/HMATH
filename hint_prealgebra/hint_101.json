What can you infer about their speeds based on the distances covered in four hours?\n4. How did you calculate the number of miles traveled by each biker after four hours?\n5. Is it possible to determine the exact speed of each biker using the information given? Why or why not?\n6. How would the difference in the number of miles traveled change if the time period was longer or shorter than four hours?\n7. Can you come up with another scenario where the difference in miles traveled by Alberto and Bjorn would be the same after four hours?"
