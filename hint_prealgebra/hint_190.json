    "solution": "Each small square has the same area so we need only divide the number of shaded squares by the total number of squares. There are $13$ of the former and $25$ of the latter, so the answer is $\\frac{13}{25}=\\boxed{52\\%}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you count the total number of small squares in the five-by-five square? \n2. How many of the small squares are shaded in the given diagram? \n3. What percentage of the total number of small squares are shaded? \n4. How did you arrive at the answer? \n5. Can you explain why each small square has the same area? \n6. Is there a different method you could use to find the percentage of shaded squares? \n7. If the size of the five-by-five square was changed, would that affect the percentage of shaded squares? \n8. Can you think of a real-world situation where knowledge of percentages could be useful?"
