    "solution": "We can count the total number of triangles that can be chosen directly, by listing them: $AEC$, $AEB$, $BED$, $BEC$, and $BDC$. Of these, the triangles with a part shaded are $AEC$, $BEC$, and $BDC$. So there is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$ probability of selecting a triangle with all or part of its interior shaded.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many triangles are there in the diagram?\n2. Can you list all the possible triangles that can be chosen?\n3.

Can you express the probability as a common fraction?"
