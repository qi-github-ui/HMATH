Can the paths be combined to find a total number of paths? \n7. What is an alternate way to get from point A to point C without going through point B? \n8. How does the knowledge of the paths from point A to B and point B to C help in finding the total number of paths? \n9. Are there any other similar problems that could use the same approach?"
