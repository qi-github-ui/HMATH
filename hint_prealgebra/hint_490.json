    "problem": "The circular region of the sign (below, left) has an area of 154 square inches. Vanessa would like to place a tiny ribbon (shaded) around the circle's edge. To be sure she has enough ribbon, she decides to buy 2 inches more of the ribbon than the original circle's circumference. How many inches of ribbon will Vanessa need to buy if she estimates $\\pi = \\frac{22}{7}$?\n\n[asy]import graph;\nsize(125,72.5);\npicture p;\ndraw(p,unitsquare);\nfilldraw(p,Circle((.5,.5),.3),white);\nlabel(p,\"Enter\",(.5,.5),ZapfChancery(\"m\",\"n\"));\nadd(p);\nfilldraw(Circle((2,.5),.4),gray(.6));\nadd(shift(1.5*right)*p);\ndraw((1.1,.5)--(1.4,.5),EndArrow(5,25));[/asy]",

    "solution": "Say the radius of the circle is $r$. Then the area of the circle is $\\pi r^2,$ which we estimate to $154=\\frac{22}{7}r^2$. If we multiply both sides by $\\frac{7}{22}$, we get $r^2=49$ or $r=7$. The circle's circumference is $2\\pi r$, which we again estimate to $\\frac{44}{7}r=44$. Vanessa wants two extra inches of ribbon, so she needs to buy $44+2=\\boxed{46}$ inches of ribbon.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How can we represent the area of the circular region in terms of the radius?\n2. Given that the area is 154 square inches, what equation can we set up to find the value of the radius?\n3. What is the estimated value of \u03c0 that we are using in this problem?\n4. How can we use the estimated value of \u03c0 and the equation from question 2 to solve for the radius?\n5. What is the value of the radius that we obtain from solving the equation?\n6. How can we find the circumference of the circle using the radius?\n7. What additional length of ribbon does Vanessa want to purchase?\n8. How can we calculate the total length of ribbon Vanessa needs to buy?\n9. What is the final result of our calculations?"
