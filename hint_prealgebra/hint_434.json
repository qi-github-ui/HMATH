    "solution": "The sum of the angle measures of a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so we must have \\[\\angle P + 111^\\circ + 113^\\circ + 92^\\circ + 128^\\circ = 540^\\circ.\\] Simplifying this equation gives $\\angle P + 444^\\circ = 540^\\circ$, which means $\\angle P = \\boxed{96^\\circ}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what is meant by the measure of an angle?\n2. How do we determine the sum of the angle measures in a pentagon?\n3. Why is the sum of the angle measures in a pentagon equal to $540$ degrees?\n4. In the given diagram, what is the relationship between angle $P$ and the other angles in the pentagon?\n5. How can we use the sum of angle measures of the pentagon to find the measure of angle $P$?\n6. Can you show the equation that represents the relationship between angle $P$ and the other angles in the pentagon?\n7. How can we solve this equation to find the measure of angle $P$?\n8. Explain why subtracting $444^\\circ$ from both sides of the equation gives us the measure of angle $P$.\n9. Can you generalize this process to find the measure of an angle in any polygon?"
