    "problem": "Ms. Hamilton's eighth-grade class wants to participate in the annual three-person-team basketball tournament.  The losing team of each game is eliminated from the tournament.  If sixteen teams compete, how many games will be played to determine the winner?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "8 games in the first round will leave 8 teams remaining.  4 games in the second round will leave 4 teams remaining.  2 games in the third round will leave two teams remaining.  One final game is played to determine the overall winner of the tournament.  Thus, there will be $8+4+2+1=\\boxed{15}$ games to eliminate 15 teams.\n\n\n\nAnother way to quickly solve this problem is to note that every team except the winner must lose exactly once.  Therefore, 15 teams must lose, and each game has one loser, which means that there are 15 games.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the goal of the problem? \n2. How many teams are participating in the tournament?\n3. How does the tournament work in terms of eliminations?\n4. Can you explain the process of elimination and how it impacts the number of games?\n5. What is the initial number of games played in the first round?\n6. How many teams remain after the first round?\n7. How does the number of games change in each subsequent round?\n8. Why do we add the numbers of games played in each round to find the total number of games?\n9. Can you come up with a general formula to determine the number of games played for any number of teams?\n10. Are there any other factors that could impact the number of games played in the tournament?"
