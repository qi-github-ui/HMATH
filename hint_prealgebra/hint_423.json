    "problem": "Given that $n$ is an integer and $0 < 4n <30$, what is the sum of all possible integer values of $n$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Dividing by $4$, we have $0<n<7\\frac{1}{2}$. The integer solutions to this chain of inequalities are $n=1,2,3,4,5,6,7$. The sum of these integers is $\\boxed{28}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given inequality and what is the condition for the variable n?\n2. How did we obtain the inequality $0 < 4n < 30$ from the given condition?\n3. Can you explain why dividing the inequality by 4 gives us the range for n?\n4. What are the possible integer solutions for n that satisfy the inequality $0 < n < 7\\frac{1}{2}$?\n5. How do we know that these are the only integer solutions within the given range?\n6. What is the sum of all the possible integer values of n?"
