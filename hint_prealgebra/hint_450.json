    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Prime factorizing 50, we find that $\\sqrt{50}=\\sqrt{2\\cdot5^2}=\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{5^2}=5\\sqrt{2}$.  Similarly, $\\sqrt{18}=\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{9}=3\\sqrt{2}$.  Five square roots of 2 plus 3 square roots of 2 is $\\boxed{8\\sqrt{2}}$.",
