    "problem": "How many numbers in the set $\\{3,13,23,33, \\ldots\\}$ can be written as the difference of two primes?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Notice that when we subtract two integers, the difference can only be odd if one integer is even and one integer is odd (even - even = even and odd - odd = even). If one integer is even, then that integer is divisible by 2 and thus not prime. The only exception is 2, the only even prime number. So one of the primes must be 2. If we add 2 to each number in the set to find the other prime, we end up with $\\{5, 15, 25, 35, \\ldots\\}$. All of the numbers in the set are divisible by 5, which means the only prime number in the set is 5. So the only number in the set  $\\{3,13,23,33, \\ldots\\}$ that can be written as the difference of two primes is $5-2=3$. The answer is $\\boxed{1}$ number.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How do we determine if a difference of two integers is odd or even? \n2. Are there any restrictions on the prime numbers that can be used in the difference? \n3. Why must one of the primes be 2? \n4. What happens when we add 2 to each number in the set? \n5. What is the resulting set of numbers after adding 2? \n6. Are there any prime numbers in the resulting set? \n7. What number in the original set can be written as the difference of two primes? \n8. How can we calculate the number of such numbers in the set?"
