    "problem": "Find the product of the least common multiple (LCM) of $8$ and $6$ and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $8$ and $6$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since $6 = 2 \\cdot 3$ and $3$ is relatively prime with $8$ while $2$ divides into both $6$ and $8$, it follows that $\\text{gcd}(6,8) = 2$. The multiples of $8$ are $8, 16, 24, 32\\ldots$ and the multiples of $6$ are $6, 12, 18, 24, 30, \\ldots$, so $\\text{lcm}(6,8) = 24$. Thus, the desired product is $2 \\times 24 = \\boxed{48}.$\n\nNotice that this product is equal to the product of the original numbers, $6\\times 8$. Is there a reason for that?",

How did we find the LCM of 6 and 8? Is there a general method for finding the LCM of two numbers?\n4. Is there a relationship between the GCD and LCM of two numbers?\n5. Can you think of other examples where we might need to find the GCD and LCM of two numbers?\n6. Can you explain why the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the original two numbers?"
