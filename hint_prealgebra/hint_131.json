    "problem": "Ming and Catherine walked to the store together to buy some pencils.  Ming bought $40$ pencils and Catherine bought $24$.  If each package of pencils sold at the store contain the same number of pencils, what is the largest possible number of pencils in a package?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the number of pencils in a package must be a divisor of both $24$ and $40$, the largest possible number of pencils in a package is the GCD of $40$ and $24$.  Factoring, $24 = 2^3\\cdot 3$ and $40 = 2^3\\cdot 5$.  The only prime common to both factorizations is $2$, raised the $3$rd power, so the GCD is $2^3 = \\boxed{8}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the first step should be in solving this problem?\n2. How can we find the largest possible number of pencils in a package by considering the number of pencils Ming and Catherine bought?\n3. What mathematical concept would be useful in finding the greatest common divisor of 40 and 24?\n4. How can we express the numbers 24 and 40 as a product of primes?\n5. What is the prime factorization of 24 and 40, and what is the common factor between them?\n6. Can you explain why the greatest common divisor is the largest possible number of pencils in a package?\n7. Are there any other real-life situations where finding the greatest common divisor could be useful?"
