    "problem": "If 4 daps are equivalent to 3 dops, and 2 dops are equivalent to 7 dips, how many daps are equivalent to 42 dips?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First, 4 daps are equivalent to 3 dops: $$\\frac{4 \\mbox{ daps}}{3 \\mbox{ dops}} = 1$$ Second, 2 dops are equivalent to 7 dips: $$ \\frac{2 \\mbox{ dops}}{7 \\mbox{ dips}} = 1$$ Hence, 8 daps are equivalent to 21 dips: $$ \\frac{4 \\mbox{ daps}}{3 \\mbox{ dops}}\\cdot \\frac{2 \\mbox{ dops}}{7 \\mbox{ dips}} = \\frac{8 \\mbox{ daps}}{21 \\mbox{ dips}} = 1$$ Conveniently, $42$ dips is exactly twice $21$ dips. So, $\\boxed{16\\text{ daps}}$ are equivalent to $42$ dips.",
