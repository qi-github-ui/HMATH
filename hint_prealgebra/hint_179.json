    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$8 = 2^3$, $15 = 3^1 \\cdot 5^1$, so lcm$[8, 15] = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 = \\boxed{120}$.\n\nNotice that, since 8 and 15 have no common factors (greater than 1), their least common multiple is equal to their product.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of \"least common multiple\"? \n2. How can we find the prime factorization of 8 and 15? \n3. What is the greatest common divisor of 8 and 15? \n4. How does the greatest common divisor relate to the least common multiple? \n5. How can we use the prime factorization of 8 and 15 to find their least common multiple? \n6. Can you think of any other numbers for which you could use a similar process to find their least common multiple? \n7. What is the significance of finding the least common multiple for two given numbers?"
