    "problem": "What is the largest prime factor of 999?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First, divide out 9 to obtain $999=9\\cdot111$.  Since $1+1+1=3$, 111 is divisible by 3.  Dividing, we find $111=3\\cdot 37$.  Therefore, $999=3^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 37=3^3\\cdot 37$ and the largest prime factor of 999 is $\\boxed{37}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you start the process of finding the largest prime factor of 999? \n2. Why is dividing out 9 the first step? Is there any significance to the number 9 in this context?\n3. Why did we divide 111 by 3? What property of the sum of its digits allows us to determine divisibility by 3?\n4. Can you explain the significance of finding that 111 can be written as 3 multiplied by 37? How does this relate to finding the largest prime factor?\n5. What is the prime factorization of 999 in terms of its prime factors? How did you arrive at this factorization?\n6. What is the largest prime factor among the factors you obtained? Can you explain why this is the largest?"
