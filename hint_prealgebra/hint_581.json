    "solution": "Breaking the outer figure into two rectangles, we find that the total area of the shaded region plus unshaded region is $10\\cdot 8 + 2\\cdot 4 = 88$.  Thus the area of the non-shaded region is $88-78 = 10$ square inches.  This means that its remaining side length is 5 inches, and its perimeter is $2(2 + 5) = \\boxed{14}$ inches.",
