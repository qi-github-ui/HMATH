    "problem": "What is the measure, in degrees, of the acute angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand of a 12-hour clock at 6:48?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "At 6:48, the minute hand is $\\frac{12}{60}(360^\\circ)=72$ degrees from the 12:00 position.  The hour hand is $\\frac{5\\frac{12}{60}}{12}(360^\\circ)=156$ degrees from the 12:00 position.  The difference in the two positions is $156^\\circ-72^\\circ=\\boxed{84}$ degrees.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the position of the minute hand at 6:48 in relation to the 12:00 position on the clock?\n2. How many degrees does the minute hand move for every minute?\n3. How many degrees does the minute hand move from the 12:00 position to the 6:48 position?\n4. What is the position of the hour hand at 6:48 in relation to the 12:00 position on the clock?\n5. How many degrees does the hour hand move for every hour?\n6. How many degrees does the hour hand move from the 12:00 position to the 6:48 position?\n7. What is the acute angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand at 6:48?\n8. How can we calculate the difference in positions between the hour hand and the minute hand?\n9. How can we find the measure, in degrees, of the acute angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand at 6:48 using the positions we calculated?\n10. What is the final answer to the problem?"
