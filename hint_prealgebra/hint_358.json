    "problem": "Simplify $\\frac{10a^3}{55a^2}$ when $a=3$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The 10 in the numerator and the 55 in the denominator have a common factor of 5. Similarly, the $a^3$ and $a^2$ have a common factor of $a^2$. So we get \\[\n\\frac{10a^3}{55a^2} = \\frac{2\\cdot 5\\cdot a^2\\cdot a^1}{11\\cdot 5 \\cdot a^2} = \\frac{2\\cdot \\cancel{5}\\cdot \\cancel{a^2}\\cdot a^1}{11\\cdot \\cancel{5} \\cdot \\cancel{a^2}} = \\frac{2a}{11}.\n\\]Substituting $a=3$ gives $\\boxed{\\frac{6}{11}}$.",
