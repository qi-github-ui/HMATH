    "problem": "Christine must buy at least $45$ fluid ounces of milk at the store. The store only sells milk in $200$ milliliter bottles. If there are $33.8$ fluid ounces in $1$ liter, then what is the smallest number of bottles that Christine could buy?  (You may use a calculator on this problem.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First we convert the amount of milk Christine must buy from ounces to liters. We use the conversion factor $\\frac{1\\ \\text{L}}{33.8\\ \\text{fl.oz}}$ to obtain $45\\ \\text{fl.oz} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{L}}{33.8\\ \\text{fl.oz}} \\approx 1.331\\ \\text{L}$. There are $1000\\ \\text{mL}$ in one liter, and $\\frac{1331}{200} \\approx 6.657$, so Christine must buy at least $\\boxed{7}$ bottles of milk at the store.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find? \n2. Can you restate the problem in your own words?\n3. What information do we have in the problem that could be useful?\n4. How can we convert the units from fluid ounces to liters? \n5. What is the conversion factor we need to use, and why?\n6. After converting to liters, what unit do we need to convert to in order to find the number of bottles? \n7. How many milliliters are there in one liter? \n8. How can we determine the number of bottles needed based on the volume of milk required and the volume of each bottle? \n9. Can you explain the steps you would take to calculate the number of bottles needed? \n10. Is there a specific method or strategy you would use to perform the calculations? Why?\n11. Is it possible to round the number of bottles down or up? Why or why not?\n12. Can you think of any other similar scenarios where unit conversion and calculation of quantities would be necessary?"
