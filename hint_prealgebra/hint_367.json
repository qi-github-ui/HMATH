    "problem": "A list of five positive integers has a median of 3 and a mean of 11. What is the maximum possible value of the list's largest element?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the 5 numbers have a mean of 11, the sum of the numbers is $5\\cdot 11 = 55$.  To make the largest number as large as possible, we make the other numbers must be as small as possible.  However, in order for the median to be 3, the middle number must be 3.  Since this is the middle number, there must be two other numbers that are at least 3.  So, we let three of the other four numbers be 1, 1, and 3 to make them as small as possible.  Finally, this means the remaining number is $55-1-1-3-3=\\boxed{47}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information in the problem?\n2. What does it mean for a list of numbers to have a median of 3 and a mean of 11? Can you explain these concepts?\n3. How can we find the sum of the five numbers in the list, given the mean?\n4. If we want to maximize the largest element in the list, what should the other numbers be?\n5. Why must the middle number in the list be 3 for the median to be 3?\n6. How can we determine the values of the remaining numbers in the list?\n7. What is the maximum possible value for the largest element in the list? How did you arrive at this conclusion?\n8. Can you think of any alternative scenarios or variations where similar reasoning and steps might be applicable?"
