    "problem": "The bottoms of two vertical poles are 12 feet apart and are on a region of flat ground. One pole is 6 feet tall and the other is 15 feet tall. How long, in feet, is a wire stretched from the top of one pole to the top of the other pole?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Picturing the situation, we have a trapezoid with the two poles as bases. We can split this trapezoid into a rectangle at the bottom and a right triangle at the top, where the hypotenuse of the right triangle is the wire stretched from the top of one pole to the top of the other pole.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.15inch);\npair A,B,C,D,F;\nA = (0,0);\nB= (12,0);\nC = (12,15);\nD = (0,6);\nF = (12,6);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--A);\ndraw(D--F,dashed);\nlabel(\"$12$\",B/2,S);\nlabel(\"$12$\",(D+F)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$6$\",D/2,W);\nlabel(\"$6$\",(F+B)/2,E);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(F+C)/2,E);\n[/asy]\n\n\nThe horizontal leg of the right triangle is 12 feet, the horizontal distance from one pole to the other. The vertical leg of the triangle is $15-6=9$ feet, the height difference of the poles. By the Pythagorean Theorem $a^2+b^2=c^2$, we can solve for the length of the hypotenuse. We get $c=\\sqrt{144+81}=\\sqrt{225}=15$. So the wire is $\\boxed{15}$ feet long.\n\nAlternatively, instead of using the Pythagorean Theorem, we notice that 9-12-$c$ has the same ratios as the 3-4-5 right triangle. So $c=3\\cdot5=\\boxed{15}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the situation in terms of a geometric shape or shapes?\n2. What is the distance between the bottoms of the poles? How tall are the poles?\n3. How can we split the shape into smaller, more manageable pieces?\n4. What kind of triangle do we have at the top of the shape?\n5. What is the length of the horizontal leg of the right triangle?\n6. What is the height difference between the poles?\n7. How can we use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the wire?\n8. Are there any other ways to find the length of the wire?\n9. Can you think of any other real-life situations where the Pythagorean Theorem might be useful?"
