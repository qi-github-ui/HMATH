    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Remembering that ``of\" means multiply, we want to find $\\frac{2}{5} \\times 25$. Since multiplication is commutative, we have: \\[\\frac{2}{5} \\times 25 = \\frac{25}{5} \\times 2\\]A fraction is another way to represent division, so $\\frac{25}{5} = 25\\div5 = 5$, and $5\\times2 = \\boxed{10}$ minutes.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find?\n2. How long does it take Alice to clean her room? Why is this information important?\n3. What does the phrase \"of that amount of time\" mean in the problem?\n4. How would we represent the fraction $\\frac{2}{5}$ as a decimal?\n5. Can we represent $\\frac{2}{5}$ as a percentage?\n6. How do we multiply a fraction by a whole number?\n7. How can we simplify $\\frac{25}{5}$?\n8. How do we calculate $5 \\times 2$?\n9. What is the final answer to the problem?"
