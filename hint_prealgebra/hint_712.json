    "problem": "What is the smallest four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 4?  (A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards, like 61216.)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Every four-digit palindrome is of the form $ABBA$, where $A$ and $B$ are digits.  The four-digit number $ABBA$ is divisible by 4 if and only if the two-digit number $BA$ is divisible by 4.  In particular, the digit $A$ must be even.\n\nSince $ABBA$ is a four-digit number, $A$ cannot be 0, so $A$ must be at least 2.  For $A = 2$, so the smallest digit $B$ for which $BA = B2$ is divisible by 4 is 12.  Therefore, the smallest smallest four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 4 is $\\boxed{2112}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How would you approach finding the smallest four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 4?\n2. Can you explain why every four-digit palindrome is of the form ABBA?\n3. Why is the four-digit number ABBA divisible by 4 if and only if the two-digit number BA is divisible by 4?\n4. What is the significance of the fact that A must be even in order for ABBA to be divisible by 4?\n5. Based on the information given, what is the smallest digit that A can be to form a four-digit number?\n6. Using A = 2, can you determine the smallest digit B for which BA is divisible by 4?\n7. What is the value of BA if A = 2 and you want it to be divisible by 4?\n8. By combining the values of A and B, what is the smallest four-digit palindrome that is divisible by 4?"
