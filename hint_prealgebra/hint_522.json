    "problem": "Adam has $15$ of a certain type of rare coin and is interested in knowing how much this collection is worth.  He discovers that $5$ of these coins are worth $12$ dollars in total. Assuming that the value of each coin is the same, how many dollars is his entire collection worth?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since $15=5 \\times 3$, the total value of his collection will be worth $3$ times the amount that the $5$ coins are worth by themselves.  Thus the total value of his coin collection is $12 \\times 3=\\boxed{36}$ dollars.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many coins does Adam have in total?\n2. What is the value of 5 coins in dollars?\n3. If the value of each coin is the same, how can we determine the value of the entire collection?\n4. Why can we multiply the value of 5 coins by 3 to find the total value?\n5. Can you explain why the total value of the collection is 36 dollars based on the given information?\n6. Are there any other scenarios where we can use a similar approach to find the total value of a collection based on a given subset?"
