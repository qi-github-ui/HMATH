    "problem": "What is the greatest common factor of 40 and 48?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$40=2^3\\cdot5$ and $48=2^4\\cdot3$. The prime factorization of their greatest common factor cannot contain any other primes besides 2 raised to no more than the 3rd power, otherwise it would not be a factor of both numbers. Thus, their GCF is $2^3=\\boxed{8}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you identify the prime factorizations of 40 and 48? \n2. What is the largest power of 2 that appears as a factor in both numbers? \n3. Why can't the greatest common factor have any primes other than 2 with a power greater than 3? \n4. How did you determine that the greatest common factor is 8? \n5. Can you think of any other numbers where you can use a similar method to find the greatest common factor?"
