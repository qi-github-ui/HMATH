    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We know that the area of a triangle is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}bh$ where $b$ is the length of the base and $h$ is the altitude of the triangle. Since we know that the area of the triangles is $600$ sq. feet and the base is $30$ feet, we have that $600 = \\frac{1}{2} (30)h$, so $600=15h$. Dividing both sides of the equation by $15$, we have that $h=40$. The altitude of the triangle is $\\boxed{40}$ feet.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the formula for finding the area of a triangle? Can you explain how it relates to the base and altitude of the triangle?\n2. Given that the area of the triangle is 600 square feet and the length of the base is 30 feet, what is the equation we can use to find the altitude of the triangle?\n3. How can we solve the equation 600 = (1/2)(30)h to find the value of h (the altitude)?\n4. What operation do we need to perform to isolate h on one side of the equation?\n5. After solving the equation, what is the value of h (the altitude) that we find?\n6. How does this answer match with what we initially expected? Does it make sense in the context of the problem?\n7. Can you think of any other scenarios in which we might use a similar method to find the altitude of a triangle given its area and base length?"
