    "solution": "There are 8 figures in total. Of these, 3 are triangles. Therefore, the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac38}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the concept of probability in this context?\n2. How many total figures are there to choose from?\n3. How many of these figures are triangles?\n4. Can you calculate the probability of choosing a triangle figure?\n5. Can you simplify the probability fraction?\n6. Is there any other way to represent the probability as a decimal or percentage?\n7. If we were to choose a figure at random multiple times, would the probability of choosing a triangle always be the same?\n8. Can you think of a different scenario where the concept of probability can be applied?"
