    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We begin by finding the prime factorizations of the numbers: \\[8 = 2^3, \\quad 12 = 2^2\\cdot 3, \\quad 24 = 2^3 \\cdot 3.\\]For the greatest common factor, $2^2$ is the largest factor that occurs in each number, so $A=2^2=4$.\n\nFor the least common multiple, the highest power of 2 that appears is 3, and the highest power of 3 that appears is 1. So $B=2^3 \\cdot 3^1 = 24$.\n\nAdding $A$ and $B$ gives $A + B = 4+24=\\boxed{28}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the greatest common factor (GCF) and least common multiple (LCM) are?\n2. How can we find the prime factorizations of the numbers 8, 12, and 24?\n3. What is the largest factor that occurs in all three numbers? Can you explain why it is the greatest common factor?\n4. Can you identify the highest power of 2 and 3 that appears in each prime factorization? How does this relate to finding the least common multiple?\n5. What is the product of the highest powers of 2 and 3? Can you explain why this is the least common multiple?\n6. How do we find the sum of the greatest common factor and the least common multiple? What is the value of A + B in this case?"
