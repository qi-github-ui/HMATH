    "problem": "A boy has the following seven coins in his pocket: $2$ pennies, $2$ nickels, $2$ dimes, and $1$ quarter. He takes out two coins, records the sum of their values, and then puts them back with the other coins. He continues to take out two coins, record the sum of their values, and put them back. How many different sums can he record at most?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The following pairs of numbers represent the values of the two coins the boy could take from his pocket: $$\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n(1,1) & (1,5) & (1,10) & (1,25) \\\\\n(5,5) & (5,10) & (5,25) & \\\\\n(10,10) & (10,25) & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$Each of the above pairs has a sum that is different from the sum of each of the other pairs. Therefore there are $\\boxed{9}$ different sums.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what the boy is doing in this problem? What is his objective?\n2. How many different types of coins does the boy have? How many of each type?\n3. If the boy takes out two coins, what are the different possible combinations he can have?\n4. Can you list all the possible sums of the values of two coins that the boy can record?\n5. Is there a pattern or rule that governs the sums that the boy can record? If so, what is it?\n6. Are there any sums that the boy cannot record? Why or why not?\n7. Can you think of a strategy to maximize the number of different sums the boy can record?\n8. What is the maximum number of different sums the boy can record based on your strategy?\n9. Are there any other scenarios or variations of the problem where similar strategies and steps can be applied?"
