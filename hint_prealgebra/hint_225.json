    "problem": "How many 4-digit positive integers exist that satisfy the following conditions: (A) Each of the first two digits must be 1, 4, or 5, and (B) the last two digits cannot be the same digit, and (C) each of the last two digits must be 5, 7, or 8?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The first two digits may be any of 3, so there are $3^2 = 9$ choices for the first two. There are $3\\times 2$ possible values for the last two, since we have 3 choices for the first and then 2 for the second, so there are $9\\times 6 = \\boxed{54}$ possible integers.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain the given conditions of the problem?\n2. How many choices are there for the first two digits? Why?\n3. What are the possible values for the last two digits? Why?\n4. How many choices are there for the last two digits? Why?\n5. How do you calculate the total number of possible integers that satisfy the given conditions?\n6. Can you think of any similar problems that require the same type of reasoning to solve?"
