    "problem": "A rectangular garden 50 feet long and 10 feet wide is enclosed by a fence. To make the garden larger, while using the same fence, its shape is changed to a square. By how many square feet does this enlarge the garden?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of the garden was 500 square feet$(50\\times 10)$ and its perimeter was 120 feet, $2\\times (50+10)$. The square garden is also enclosed by 120 feet of fence so its sides are each 30 feet long. The square garden's area is 900 square feet ($30\\times 30)$. and this has increased the garden area by $\\boxed{400}$ square feet.

What is the perimeter of the original rectangular garden?\n4. How long are each side of the square garden?\n5. What is the area of the square garden?\n6. How much larger is the area of the square garden compared to the area of the original rectangular garden?\n7. How did you find the increase in area?\n8. Can you think of any other scenarios where a similar approach can be used to find the increase in area when changing the shape of a garden or any other enclosed area?"
