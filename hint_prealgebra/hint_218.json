    "problem": "The diagonal of a square is $\\sqrt{2}$ inches long. How many inches long is the side of the square?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since a diagonal of a square breaks up the square into two 45-45-90 triangles, a diagonal is $\\sqrt{2}$ times longer than a side. Thus, the length of a side of the square is $\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2}=\\boxed{1}$ inch.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How do you know that the diagonal of a square breaks up the square into two 45-45-90 triangles?\n2. Can you explain why a diagonal of a square is $\\sqrt{2}$ times longer than a side?\n3. Why is it useful to know the relationship between the diagonal and the side length of a square?\n4. How could we use the Pythagorean theorem to confirm the relationship between the diagonal and the side length of a square?\n5. In this problem, the diagonal of the square is $\\sqrt{2}$ inches long. What can we conclude about the length of each side of the square?\n6. Are there any other geometric figures or shapes where the diagonal is related to the side length in a similar way?"
