    "solution": "The area of the two squares are $(2x)^2=4x^2$ square inches and $(5x)^2=25x^2$ square inches, and the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(2x)(5x)=5x^2$ square inches.  We solve \\[\n25x^2+4x^2+5x^2=850\n\\] to find $x=\\pm\\sqrt{850/34}=\\pm5$.  We take the positive solution $x=\\boxed{5}$.",
