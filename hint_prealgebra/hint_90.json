    "solution": "All angle measures will be in degrees. $\\angle DCB = 180 - 60 = 120$, and since opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal, we have $\\angle A = \\angle DCB = 120$.  Hence the degree measure of $\\angle A$ is $\\boxed{120}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what a parallelogram is and what kind of properties it has?\n2. How many angles does a quadrilateral have, and what is the sum of their degree measures?\n3. How do we know that angle DCB measures 60 degrees?\n4. How does the fact that opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal help us to find the degree measure of angle A?\n5. Can you think of other theorems or properties that might be useful in solving problems like this involving angles and parallelograms?"
