    "problem": "If an integer is divisible by $4$ and the sum of its last two digits is $13$, then what is the product of its last two digits?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If $A$ is the tens digit and $B$ the units digit, then the two-digit number $AB$ (having $A$ in the tens place and $B$ in the units place) must be one of the following: $49$, $58$, $67$, $76$, $85$, $94$.  Since the original number was divisible by $4$, $AB$ must be divisible by $4$.  So $AB = 76$ is the only possibility, and $A\\cdot B = 7\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{42}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the definition of an integer?\n2. Can you explain what it means for an integer to be divisible by 4?\n3. How do you check if a number is divisible by 4?\n4. What are the possible last two digits of a number that is divisible by 4?\n5. If the sum of the last two digits of a number is 13, what are the possible combinations of digits?\n6. How did we determine that $AB$ must be equal to 76?\n7. What is the product of 7 and 6, and how does it relate to the problem?\n8. Can you think of any other rules or tricks for determining divisibility of integers by certain numbers?"
