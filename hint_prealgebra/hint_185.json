    "problem": "A survey of $120$ teachers determined the following:\n\n$70$ had high blood pressure\n\n$40$ had heart trouble\n\n$20$ had both high blood pressure and heart trouble\n\nWhat percent of the teachers surveyed had neither high blood pressure nor heart trouble?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Of the 40 who had heart trouble, 20 also had high blood pressure, so there are $40-20=20$ teachers who only have heart trouble.  Similarly, there are $70-20 =50$ teachers with only high blood pressure.  So, of the 120 teachers total, there are $20 + 20 + 50 = 90$ teachers with one of these two maladies.  That means $120-90 = 30$ teachers with neither, which is $\\frac{30}{120} = \\boxed{25\\%}$ of the teachers.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.05cm);\nlabel(\"Heart Trouble\", (2,74));\nlabel(\"High Blood Pressure\", (80,74));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(\"$20$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$20$\",(28,58));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$50$\",(63,58));\n[/asy]",

How many teachers had both high blood pressure and heart trouble?\n5. How many teachers had neither high blood pressure nor heart trouble?\n6. Can you create a Venn diagram to visually represent the information given?\n7. If there were 200 teachers surveyed instead of 120, would the percentage of teachers without high blood pressure or heart trouble change?\n8. If 30 out of the 40 teachers with heart trouble were also overweight, what percentage of the total sample size is overweight and has heart trouble?"
