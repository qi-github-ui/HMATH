    "problem": "One interior angle of a convex polygon is 160 degrees. The rest of the interior angles of the polygon are each 112 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let us call $x$ the number of sides in the polygon.  The sum of all the angles of the polygon with $x$ sides is $180(x-2)$, but with the information given, it can also be expressed as $160 + 112(x-1)$.  Therefore, setting these two equations equal: \\begin{align*}\n180(x-2) &= 160 + 112(x-1)\\\\\n180x - 360 &= 160 + 112x - 112\\\\\n68x &= 408\\\\\nx &= 6\\\\\n\\end{align*} Thus, it has $\\boxed{6}$ sides, and is a hexagon.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you define what is meant by a convex polygon?\n2. Can you explain why the sum of interior angles in a polygon with x sides is equal to 180(x-2)?\n3.
