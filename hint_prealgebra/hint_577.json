    "problem": "How many multiples of 3 are between 62 and 215?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The first multiple of $3$ that is greater than $62$ is $63$, and the last multiple of $3$ that is less than $215$ is $213$. We're only interested in numbers that are divisible by $3$, and the list of such numbers is $$63, 66, 69, \\ldots, 210, 213.$$ To count the number of numbers in this list, first divide each by $3$. Our list then becomes $$21, 22, 23, \\ldots, 70, 71.$$ Finally, subtract $20$ from each number, and the list becomes $$1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 50, 51.$$ Thus, there are $\\boxed{51}$ multiples of $3$ between $62$ and $215$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How did we determine the first multiple of 3 greater than 62 and the last multiple of 3 less than 215?\n2. Why are we only interested in numbers that are divisible by 3?\n3. Can you explain the step of dividing each number by 3? What does this help us achieve?\n4. What is the purpose of subtracting 20 from each number in the list?\n5. How does the final list of numbers help us find the answer to the problem?\n6. Can you think of other situations where we might need to find multiples of a certain number within a given range?"
