    "solution": "The maximum number of points at which a line can intersect 1 circle is 2 distinct points.  Thus, for 3 circles, the maximum should be $3 \\times 2 = 6$ points at most.  If you're going for speed, you should probably guess 6 points at this point with a reasonable degree of certainty.  If you have time and want to be certain, you should only check for the existence of a line that intersects the three circles at $\\boxed{6}$ distinct points, because it is impossible that a line could intersect the circles at more than 6 points.  (There are, in fact, many lines that satisfy the conditions.)",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what coplanar means? \n2. How would you define the intersection of two circles?\n3. Can you explain how three coplanar circles can intersect? \n4. What is the maximum number of points at which a line can intersect 1 circle? \n5. Why should the maximum number of points on the circles that a line passing through all three circles can touch be 6? \n6. Can you think of any other geometric shapes that intersect in a similar way?"
