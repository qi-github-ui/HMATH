    "problem": "In the figure below, the largest circle has a radius of six meters. Five congruent smaller circles are placed as shown and are lined up in east-to-west and north-to-south orientations. What is the radius in meters of one of the five smaller circles?\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(3cm,3cm);\n\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1));\n\ndraw(Circle((0,2),1));\n\ndraw(Circle((0,-2),1));\n\ndraw(Circle((2,0),1));\n\ndraw(Circle((-2,0),1));\n\ndraw(Circle((0,0),3));\n\n[/asy]",

    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We can see that the diameters of three of the smaller circles make up the diameter of the larger circle. It follows that the radius of one of the smaller circles is one-third of the radius of the larger circle. Since the larger circle has a radius of 6 meters, our answer is $6/3 = \\boxed{2}$ meters.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what you see in the figure?\n2. How are the smaller circles arranged in relation to the larger circle?\n3. What do you notice about the diameters of the three smaller circles that line up with the diameter of the larger circle?\n4. How does the radius of one of the smaller circles relate to the radius of the larger circle?\n5. Based on your observations, what can you conclude about the relationship between the radius of the smaller circles and the radius of the larger circle?\n6. If the radius of the larger circle is 6 meters, what is the radius of one of the smaller circles?\n7. Can you explain why the radius of one of the smaller circles is one-third of the radius of the larger circle?"
