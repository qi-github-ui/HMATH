    "problem": "Of the 36 students in Richelle's class, 12 prefer chocolate pie, 8 prefer apple, and 6 prefer blueberry.  Half of the remaining students prefer cherry pie and half prefer lemon.  For Richelle's pie graph showing this data, how many degrees should she use for cherry pie?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since $12 + 8 + 6 = 26$, there are $36-26= 10$ children who prefer cherry or lemon pie.  These ten are divided into equal parts of 5 each.\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{36} \\times 360^{\\circ} = 5 \\times 10^{\\circ} = \\boxed{50^{\\circ}}. \\]",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of students in Richelle's class?\n2. How many students prefer chocolate pie, apple pie, and blueberry pie, respectively?\n3. What is the formula for calculating the number of degrees for each category in a pie graph?\n4. How many students prefer cherry or lemon pie?\n5. Why are these ten students divided into equal parts of 5 each?\n6. What is the total number of degrees in a pie graph?\n7. How would you calculate the number of degrees for the lemon pie category?\n8. Is it necessary for Richelle to include a key or legend in her pie graph? Why or why not?\n9. Can you think of other types of graphs that would be useful for displaying this data?\n10. Why is it important to present data in an organized and visually appealing way?"
