    "problem": "The mean of one set of five numbers is 13, and the mean of a separate set of six numbers is 24. What is the mean of the set of all eleven numbers?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the numbers from the first set is $5\\cdot 13=65$.  The sum of the numbers from the second set is $24\\cdot 6 = 144$.  The sum of all the numbers in the set is $144+65=209$, so the average of the 11 numbers in the set is $209/11=\\boxed{19}$.",

What is the sum of the numbers in the second set?\n5. How can we find the sum of all the numbers in the set?\n6. How is the mean calculated using the sum of all the numbers in the set?\n7. What is the mean of the set of all eleven numbers in this case?"
