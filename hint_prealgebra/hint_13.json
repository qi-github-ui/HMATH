    "problem": "Find $r$ if $3(r-7) = 4(2-2r) + 4$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Expanding both products gives \\[3r - 3\\cdot 7 = 4\\cdot 2 - 4\\cdot 2r + 4,\\] so $3r - 21 = 8 - 8r + 4$.  Simplifying the right-hand side gives $3r -21 = 12-8r$.  Adding $8r$ and 21 to both sides gives $11r = 33$, so $r=\\boxed{3}$.",
