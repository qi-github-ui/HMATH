    "solution": "The only three teams that won more than 20 games won 25, 30, and 35 games.  Since the Patriots and the Mounties both won more games than the Cubs, the Cubs must have won 25 games.  Since the Mounties won more games than the Patriots, the Mounties won 35 games and the Patriots won $\\boxed{30}$ games.",
