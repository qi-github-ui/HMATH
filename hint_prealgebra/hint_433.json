    "problem": "The fenced area of a yard is a 15-foot by 12-foot rectangular region with a 3-foot by 3-foot square cut out, as shown. What is the area of the region within the fence, in square feet?\n\n[asy]draw((0,0)--(16,0)--(16,12)--(28,12)--(28,0)--(60,0)--(60,48)--(0,48)--cycle);\nlabel(\"15'\",(30,48),N);\nlabel(\"12'\",(60,24),E);\nlabel(\"3'\",(16,6),W);\nlabel(\"3'\",(22,12),N);\n[/asy]",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Instead of calculating the area by subdividing into smaller regions, let us calculate the area of the large rectangle, and then subtract the small square cut out.  The total area of the rectangle is $15 \\times 12 = 180$, and the area of the small square is $3\\times 3 = 9$, making for an area of $180 - 9 = \\boxed{171}$ square feet inside the fence.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the fenced area of the yard in this question? \n2. What is the total area of the rectangular region outside of the cut-out square? \n3. What is the area of the cut-out square, and how did you calculate it? \n4. Why are we subtracting the area of the cut-out square from the total area of the rectangular region? \n5. What is the equation or expression that describes the area of the region inside of the fence? \n6. How can we use what we know about the total area and the cut-out square to calculate the area inside of the fence? \n7. Are there any alternative methods you can think of to calculate the area inside of the fence? \n8. Can you explain, step by step, how you arrived at your final answer for the area inside of the fence?"
