    "problem": "Bob's favorite number is between $50$ and $100$.  It is a multiple of $11$, but not a multiple of $2$.  The sum of its digits is a multiple of $3$.  What is Bob's favorite number?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We will list out the multiples of $11$ between $50$ and $100$, and eliminate all the multiples that don't satisfy the other conditions.  If our work is correct, there should only be one number, the answer, that satisfies all the conditions.\n\nThe multiples of $11$ that we are interested in are $55$, $66$, $77$, $88$, and $99$. $66$ and $88$ are multiples of $2$, so they are out.  Now, of the remaining numbers, only $99$ has a digit-sum that is a multiple of $3$ ($9+9=18$).  Therefore, Bob's favorite number is $\\boxed{99}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What do we know about Bob's favorite number?\n2. Can you list the multiples of 11 between 50 and 100?\n3. How can we determine if a number is a multiple of 2 or not?\n4. Can you explain what it means for a number's digits to have a sum that is a multiple of 3?\n5. Using the conditions given, which multiples of 11 between 50 and 100 satisfy all the conditions?\n6. Why can we eliminate the numbers that are multiples of 2?\n7. Among the remaining numbers, which one has a digit-sum that is a multiple of 3?\n8. How can we be sure that this number is indeed Bob's favorite number?"
