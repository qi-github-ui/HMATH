    "problem": "A car travels 192 miles on 6 gallons of gas. How far can it travel on 8 gallons of gas?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$\\frac{8}{6}=\\frac{4}{3}$ so 8 gallons is $4/3$ as much gas as 6 gallons is. Since the distance that a car can travel is directly proportional to the amount of gas that it has, if a car can travel $192$ miles on 6 gallons of gas, it can travel $192 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}=64 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{256}$ miles on 8 gallons of gas.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in solving this problem?\n2. What does it mean for two quantities to be directly proportional?\n3. How can we determine the constant of proportionality in this problem?\n4. Why can we use the fraction $\\frac{8}{6}=\\frac{4}{3}$ to represent the relationship between the two quantities?\n5. How can we use the constant of proportionality to find the distance the car can travel on 8 gallons of gas?\n6. Can you think of any other scenarios in which direct proportionality can be applied?"
