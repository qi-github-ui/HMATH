    "problem": "How many interior diagonals does an icosahedron have?  (An $\\emph{icosahedron}$ is a 3-dimensional figure with 20 triangular faces and 12 vertices, with 5 faces meeting at each vertex.  An $\\emph{interior}$ diagonal is a segment connecting two vertices which do not lie on a common face.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 12 vertices in the icosahedron, so from each vertex there are potentially 11 other vertices to which we could extend a diagonal.  However, 5 of these 11 points are connected to the original point by an edge, so they are not connected by interior diagonals.  So each vertex is connected to 6 other points by interior diagonals.  This gives a preliminary count of $12 \\times 6 = 72$ interior diagonals.  However, we have counted each diagonal twice (once for each of its endpoints), so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcounting, and the answer is $\\dfrac{12 \\times 6}{2} = \\boxed{36}$ diagonals.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is an icosahedron, and how many faces, edges, and vertices does it have?\n2. How do we define an interior diagonal in the context of an icosahedron?\n3. How many possible endpoints are there for each vertex to connect to?\n4. Can a diagonal connect two vertices that are already connected by an edge? Why or why not?\n5. How many vertices can each vertex be connected to by an interior diagonal?\n6. How can we use this information to estimate the total count of interior diagonals?\n7. Why do we need to divide our preliminary count by 2?\n8. Can you calculate the final number of interior diagonals in an icosahedron using the information we discussed?"
