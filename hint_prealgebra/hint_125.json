    "problem": "The length of a rectangle is increased by $25\\%$, but the width of the rectangle is decreased to keep the area of the rectangle  unchanged.  By what percent was the rectangle's width  decreased?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the original area be $x$. Since the area of the rectangle is length multiplied by width, increasing the length of a rectangle by 25 percent increases the area to $1.25x$. We need to multiply this area by some number $y$ to decrease it back to $x$. We have the equation $1.25xy=x\\Rightarrow y=1/1.25=.8$. So the width needs to be decreased to $.8$ times of the original in order to change the area back to the original area. Thus, the width needs to be adjusted $\\boxed{20}$ percent.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the original area of the rectangle?\n2. How does increasing the length of a rectangle affect its area?\n3. Can you explain why the area of the rectangle after increasing the length by 25% is 1.25 times the original area?\n4. What does it mean for the area to be unchanged when the width is decreased after increasing the length?\n5. How can we mathematically express the fact that the area remains the same?\n6. What is the equation that relates the original area, the increased length, the original width, and the decreased width?\n7. Can you solve the equation to find the value of y?\n8. What does the value of y represent in the context of the problem?\n9. How can we interpret the value of y in terms of percentage?\n10. What percent decrease in width corresponds to a value of y equal to 0.8?\n11. Does the result make sense? Why or why not?"
