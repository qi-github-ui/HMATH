    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To subtract fractions, you must have a common denominator. In this case, since 51 is a multiple of 17, the common denominator is 51. So we get \\[\\frac{7\\cdot3}{17\\cdot3} - \\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{21}{51} - \\frac{4}{51}.\\]Using the distributive law, we can simplify this to \\[\\frac{21 - 4}{51} = \\frac{17}{51}.\\]But $\\frac{17}{51}$ can be written as $\\frac{17\\cdot1}{17\\cdot3}$, so our final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the first step to subtracting fractions? Can you explain why?\n2. Can you think of any other situations where finding a common denominator is necessary?\n3. How did you determine that 51 is a multiple of 17? Is there a way to check if two numbers are multiples of each other?\n4. When simplifying $\\frac{21}{51} - \\frac{4}{51}$, why did you choose to subtract the numerators and keep the denominator the same?\n5. How did you simplify $\\frac{21 - 4}{51}$? Is there another way to simplify this expression?\n6. Can you think of a real-life situation where subtracting fractions with a common denominator would be useful?\n7. Are there any shortcuts or strategies that can be used to simplify arithmetic with fractions?\n8. If the fractions had different denominators, how would you approach subtracting them?\n9. Is it possible to subtract fractions without finding a common denominator? Why or why not?\n10. Can you think of any other examples where subtracting fractions would require similar steps or thinking?"
