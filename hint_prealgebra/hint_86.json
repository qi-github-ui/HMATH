    "problem": "What is the 100th digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal representation of $\\frac{13}{90}$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Recall that for any digit $d$ between 1 and 8 inclusive, $d/9=0.\\overline{d}$.  Rewrite $13/90$ as $\\frac{1}{10}\\cdot\\frac{13}{9}$ to find that  \\[\n\\frac{13}{90}=\\frac{1}{10}\\left(1\\frac{4}{9}\\right)=\\frac{1}{10}(1.\\overline{4})=0.1\\overline{4}.\n\\]Every digit beyond the tenths digit is $\\boxed{4}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given problem asking us to find?\n2. How can we rewrite the fraction $\\frac{13}{90}$ using the given recall about repeating decimals?\n3. Why did we rewrite the fraction as $\\frac{1}{10}\\left(1\\frac{4}{9}\\right)$? What is the significance of this representation?\n4. How can we express the fraction $\\frac{1}{10}(1.\\overline{4})$ in decimal form? How does this relate to the original problem?\n5. Why is the digit \"4\" repeating in the decimal representation of $\\frac{13}{90}$? What does this tell us about the pattern of digits?\n6. Since the digit \"4\" repeats, how can we determine the 100th digit to the right of the decimal point?\n7. Can you think of any other similar problems involving repeating decimals where these concepts and steps might be useful?"
