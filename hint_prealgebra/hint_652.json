    "solution": "Since the measure of angle $C$ is twice the measure of angle $B$, $\\angle C = 2\\cdot 21^\\circ = 42^\\circ$. It follows that $\\angle A = 180^\\circ - 21^\\circ - 42^\\circ = \\boxed{117^\\circ}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How did we determine that the measure of angle $C$ is $42^\\circ$?\n2. What relationship exists between the angles in a triangle?\n3. Can you explain why the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$?\n4. How can we use this relationship to find the measure of angle $A$?\n5. Are there any other ways to find the measure of angle $A$ in this triangle?\n6. Can you think of any real-life examples where we might need to determine the measure of an angle in a triangle?"
