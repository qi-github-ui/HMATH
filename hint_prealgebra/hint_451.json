    "problem": "Football tickets cost $\\$13.50$ each. What is the maximum number of tickets Jane can buy with $\\$100.00$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since $n$ football tickets cost $(13.5)n$ dollars, Jane can buy $n$ tickets only if $(13.5)n \\le 100$. Dividing both sides of this inequality by $13.5$, we have $$n \\le \\frac{100}{13.5}.$$ We can rewrite $\\frac{100}{13.5}$ as $\\frac{200}{27}$. As a mixed number, this is $7\\frac{11}{27}$, since $27$ divides into $200$ seven times with a remainder of $11$. Since Jane can only buy a whole number of tickets, the largest number of tickets she can buy is $\\boxed{7}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the problem is asking us to find?\n2. How might we represent the cost of football tickets mathematically?\n3. If each football ticket costs $13.50, how can we determine the maximum number of tickets Jane can buy with $100.00?\n4. What does the inequality $(13.5)n \\leq 100$ represent in this problem?\n5. How can we solve this inequality to find the maximum number of tickets Jane can buy?\n6. What does $\\frac{100}{13.5}$ represent? Can you express it as a mixed number?\n7. Based on the calculation, what is the largest number of tickets Jane can buy?"
