    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We know that $x$ is between 39 and 80, and since $6^2 = 36 < 39$ and $9^2 = 81 > 80$, this means that $6^2 < x < 9^2$. This leaves us with two possibilities for $x$, which are $7^2 = 49$, and $8^2 = 64$. We then see that only 64 is divisible by four, so $x =$ $\\boxed{64}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How do we know that $x$ is between 39 and 80?\n2. What is the relationship between the square of a number and divisibility by four?\n3. How did we determine that $6^2 < x < 9^2$?\n4. Why did we eliminate 49 as a possibility for $x$?\n5. How did we determine that 64 is divisible by four?\n6. Are there any other square numbers between 39 and 80 that are divisible by four?"
