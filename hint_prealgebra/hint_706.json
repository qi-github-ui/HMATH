    "problem": "Everyone in a class of 30 students takes math and history.  Seven students received an A in history and 13 received an A in math, including four that received an A in both courses. How many students did not receive an A in any of these two courses?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Adding the numbers of students with A's in history and math gives $7+13 = 20$.  But this counts the 4 kids who got A's in both twice, so there are $20-4=16$ different students total who received an A in at least one of the courses.  That leaves $30-16=\\boxed{14}$ who didn't get an A in either.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you explain what the problem is asking for?\n2. How many students received an A in history only? How many received an A in math only?\n3. If you add the number of students who received an A in history only and the number of students who received an A in math only, what is the total?\n4. How can you adjust the total to account for the students who received an A in both courses?\n5. How many different students received an A in at least one of the courses?\n6. How many students did not receive an A in any of the courses?"
