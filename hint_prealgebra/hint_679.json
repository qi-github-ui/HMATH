    "solution": "The only side of Figure 2 we are not given is the bottom.  This is the sum of the top horizontal segments in Figure 1, which is $2+1+1=4$.  So the length of the segments in Figure $2$ is $8+4+6+1=\\boxed{19}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information about Figure 1 and Figure 2?\n2. How many sides are removed from Figure 1 to form Figure 2?\n3. What is the length of the bottom segment in Figure 2?\n4. How can we determine the length of the bottom segment in Figure 2 based on the given information?\n5. What is the sum of the top horizontal segments in Figure 1?\n6. How does that sum relate to the length of the bottom segment in Figure 2?\n7. How do we calculate the total length of the segments in Figure 2?"
