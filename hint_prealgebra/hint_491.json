    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We first recognize that $\\frac{1}{4}$ is a common fraction in each of the five sums, and so the relative size of the sums depends only on the other fractions. Since $\\frac{1}{3}$ is the largest of the fractions $$\\frac{1}{5}, \\ \\frac{1}{6}, \\ \\frac{1}{3}, \\ \\frac{1}{8}, \\ \\text{and} \\ \\frac{1}{7},$$ we conclude that $\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{3}$ is the largest sum. We can simplify this sum by using a common denominator of $12:$ $$\n\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3\\cdot1}{3\\cdot4}+\\frac{4\\cdot1}{4\\cdot 3}\n= \\frac{3+4}{12}\n= \\frac{7}{12}.\n$$ The answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{12}}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you identify a common fraction in all of the given sums?\n2. How can we compare the relative size of the sums without considering the common fraction?\n3. Which of the fractions $\\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{6}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{8},$ and $\\frac{1}{7}$ is the largest? Why?\n4. How can we add $\\frac{1}{4}$ and the largest fraction to find the largest sum?\n5. Can we simplify the sum $\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{3}$? If so, how?\n6. What is the final answer expressed as a fraction in simplest form?"
