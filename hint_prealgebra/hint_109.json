    "problem": "Dave's sister baked $3$ dozen pies of which half contained chocolate, two thirds contained marshmallows, three-fourths contained cayenne, and one-sixths contained salted soy nuts.  What is the largest possible number of pies that had none of these ingredients?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "She baked 36 pies.  Of these\n\n1. $\\frac12\\cdot36=18$ contained chocolate\n\n2. $\\frac23\\cdot36=24$ contained marshmallows\n\n3. $\\frac34\\cdot36=27$ contained cayenne\n\n4. $\\frac16\\cdot36=6$  contained salted soy nuts.\n\n\n\nAt most 9 pies do not contain cayenne.  It is possible, however that all of the chocolate, marshmallow, and salted soy nut pies are among the other 27 pies, so there could be at most $\\boxed{9}$ pies without any of these ingredients.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the total number of pies that Dave's sister baked?\n2. How many pies contained chocolate?\n3. How many pies contained marshmallows?\n4. How many pies contained cayenne?\n5. How many pies contained salted soy nuts?\n6. Is it possible for a pie to contain both chocolate and marshmallows? Why or why not?\n7. Based on the information given, what is the maximum number of pies that could have none of these ingredients?\n8. Can you think of a scenario where the maximum number of pies without any of these ingredients would be different? Explain your reasoning.\n9. If there were 9 pies without any of these ingredients and the rest had at least one of these ingredients, how many pies would contain both marshmallows and cayenne?"
