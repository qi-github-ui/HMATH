    "solution": "If we label the six points of our hexagon $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, and $F$, diagonals can only be drawn between non-adjacent points. Therefore, the diagonals are $\\overline{AC}$, $\\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{AE}$, $\\overline{BD}$, $\\overline{BE}$, $\\overline{BF}$, $\\overline{CE}$, $\\overline{CF}$, and $\\overline{DF}$. There are $\\boxed{9}$ diagonals that can be drawn.

    "socratic_questions": "1. What is a diagonal and how is it different from a side of a hexagon?\n2. Can you visualize the hexagon and identify the non-adjacent points?\n3. How many pairs of non-adjacent points can you find in the given hexagon?\n4. How many diagonals can be drawn by connecting each pair of non-adjacent points?\n5. Are there any diagonals that are the same when you consider the order of points? Why or why not?\n6. How many unique diagonals can be formed by connecting the non-adjacent points?\n7. What is the total count of unique diagonals for the given hexagon?"
