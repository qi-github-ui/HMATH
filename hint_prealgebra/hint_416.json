    "problem": "A circle has an area of $M\\text{ cm}^2$ and a circumference of $N\\text{ cm}$. If $\\dfrac{M}{N}=20$, what is the radius of the circle, in cm?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Suppose the radius of the circle is $r$ cm.\n\nThen the area $M$ is $\\pi r^2\\text{ cm}^2$ and the circumference $N$ is $2\\pi r\\text{ cm}$.\n\nThus, $\\frac{\\pi r^2}{2\\pi r} = 20$ or $\\frac{r}{2}=20$ or $r=\\boxed{40}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the given information in this problem?\n2. What are the formulas for the area and circumference of a circle?\n3. How can we represent the relationship between the area and the circumference using equations?\n4. What does the equation $\\frac{M}{N} = 20$ represent in terms of the circle's properties?\n5. How can we manipulate the equation to solve for the radius, given $\\frac{M}{N}$?\n6. Is it possible for the radius to be negative or zero in this context? Why or why not?\n7. Can you think of any other scenarios where the area and circumference of a circle might have a specific ratio? How would you approach solving those problems?"
