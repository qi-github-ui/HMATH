    "problem": "Robin bought a four-scoop ice cream cone having a scoop each of vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and cherry. In how many orders can the four scoops be stacked on the cone if they are stacked one on top of the other?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are four choices for the bottom scoop. Once this decision is made, there are only 3 choices for the scoop above that.  Similarly there are 2 choices for the third scoop, and the final scoop is uniquely determined.  In total, there are $4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot1 = \\boxed{24}$ orders.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find? \n2. How many scoops are there in the ice cream cone? \n3. How many choices do we have for the bottom scoop? \n4. After deciding the bottom scoop, how many choices do we have for the scoop above it? \n5. Are all the scoops distinct (different)? \n6. How many choices do we have for the third scoop? \n7. Can we use the fundamental counting principle to solve this problem? \n8. How many different ways can we arrange the four scoops on the cone? \n9. Is there any other way to solve this problem? \n10. Can you think of a similar problem that involves the fundamental counting principle?"
