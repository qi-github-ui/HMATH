    "problem": "A square has an area of $25.$ A rectangle has the same width as the square. The length of the rectangle is double its width. What is the area of the rectangle?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "For the square to have an area of $25,$ each side length must be $\\sqrt{25}=5.$\n\nThe rectangle's width is equal to that of the square and therefore must also be $5.$ The length of the rectangle is double its width or $5\\times 2=10.$ The area of the rectangle is thus $5\\times 10=\\boxed{50}.$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step in finding the area of the rectangle?\n2. How are the dimensions of the square related to the dimensions of the rectangle?\n3. Why does the rectangle have the same width as the square?\n4. How did you determine the length of the rectangle to be double its width?\n5. Can you explain why the area of the rectangle is calculated by multiplying the width by the length?\n6. Can you think of any other situations where the relationship between width and length could be used to find area?"
