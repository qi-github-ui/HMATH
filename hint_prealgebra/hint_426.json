    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 26 choices of letters for each of the first two spots, and 10 choices of digits for each of the next 3, for a total of $26^2 \\times 10^3 = \\boxed{676,\\!000}$ different plates.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What are the components of a valid license plate in Xanadu?\n2. How many choices are there for the first letter? And for the second letter?\n3. How many choices are there for each digit? How many digits are there in total?\n4. How can we calculate the total number of different plates?\n5. Can you explain the reasoning behind using exponentiation in the calculation?\n6. Can you think of any other scenarios where similar calculations or principles might apply?"
