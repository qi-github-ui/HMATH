    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$n+(n+1)+(n+2)=3n+3$.  So $3n+3=9\\Rightarrow n=\\boxed{2}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe the first step you would take to solve this equation?\n2. Do you know any other methods besides the one described above that can be used to solve equations like this?\n3. If you chose to use the method of combining like terms, how would you simplify the left side of the equation?\n4. Why is it possible to simplify the left side of the equation in this way? What property allows us to combine the terms?\n5. What does the simplified equation tell us about the value of n? Can you explain why and how we know that n equals 2?\n6. Can you think of any other types of equations where similar thinking and steps would be used to solve them?"
