    "problem": "One caterer charges a basic fee of $\\$100$ plus $\\$15$ per person. A second caterer charges a basic fee of $\\$200$ plus $\\$12$ per person. What is the least number of people for which the second caterer is cheaper?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If $x$ is the number of people, the first caterer charges $100+15x$ dollars, while the second charges $200+12x$ dollars.  We want $$100+15x>200+12x.$$ Subtracting $100$ from both sides gives $$15x > 100+12x,$$ then subtracting $12x$ from both sides gives $$3x>100.$$ Finally, dividing both sides by $3$ gives $x=\\frac{100}{3}=33\\frac{1}{3}$, so the smallest number of people is $\\boxed{34}$.",

How can you represent the cost of the second caterer as a function of the number of people attending?\n4. What is the inequality that needs to be solved to find the minimum number of people for which the second caterer is cheaper?\n5. How did you solve the inequality to find the answer?\n6. Is there a possibility of the two caterers charging the same amount? If so, how can you find that number of people?\n7. Can this problem be generalized to compare the costs of more than two caterers? If so, what would be the steps to solve it?"
