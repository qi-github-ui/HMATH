    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Listing the prime factors of $39$ and $91$, we have $39 = 3 \\cdot 13$ and $91 = 7 \\cdot 13$. The only prime common to both factorizations is $13$ (raised to the $1$st power), so the greatest common divisor must be $\\boxed{13}$.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you list the prime factors of 39 and 91?\n2. What is the definition of a greatest common divisor?\n3. Based on the prime factorizations of 39 and 91, can you identify any common prime factors?\n4. Why is the factor 13 common to both factorizations?\n5. Why is the exponent of 13 in both factorizations 1?\n6. How does the concept of greatest common divisor relate to finding the factors of two numbers?\n7. Can you think of any other numbers where you can use a similar approach to find the greatest common divisor?"
