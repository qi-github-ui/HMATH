    "solution": "First, multiply the fractions to get $$\\frac{18}{17}\\cdot\\frac{13}{24}\\cdot\\frac{68}{39}=\\frac{18\\cdot 13 \\cdot 68}{17 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 39}.$$Before we start multiplying these numbers out, let's see if the numerator and denominator share any common factors. 18 and 24 have a common factor of 6, 13 and 39 have a common factor of 13, while 17 and 68 have a common factor of 17.  $$\\frac{18}{17}\\cdot\\frac{13}{24}\\cdot\\frac{68}{39}=\\frac{\\cancel{6}\\cdot3}{\\cancel{17}\\cdot1}\\cdot\\frac{\\cancel{13}\\cdot1}{\\cancel{6}\\cdot4}\\cdot\\frac{\\cancel{17}\\cdot4}{\\cancel{13}\\cdot3}.$$After this first round of simplification, we notice that we can cancel 4 and 3 from the resulting fraction, giving $$\\frac{\\cancel{3}}{\\cancel{1}}\\cdot\\frac{\\cancel{1}}{\\cancel{4}}\\cdot\\frac{\\cancel{4}}{\\cancel{3}}=\\boxed{1}.$$",
