    "problem": "The average age of the 10 females in a choir is 30 years. The average age of the 15 males in the same choir is 35 years. What is the average age, in years, of the 25 people in the choir?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $S$ be the sum of the ages of the females. Then $30 = \\frac{S}{10}$ (since the average is the sum divided by the number of elements), so $S = (30)(10)$. Similarly, the sum of the males' ages is $(35)(15)$. So the sum of all the ages is $(30)(10)+(35)(15)$. There are a total of 25 people, so the average is $$\n\\frac{(30)(10)+(35)(15)}{25} = \\boxed{33}.\n$$",
    "socratic_questions": "1. What is the problem asking us to find?\n2. Can you explain what the average age represents in this problem?\n3. How did we find the sum of the ages for the females and the males?\n4. Why did we divide the sum of the females' ages by 10 and the sum of the males' ages by 15?\n5. How did we combine the sum of the females' ages and the sum of the males' ages?\n6. Why did we divide the combined sum of the ages by 25 to find the average age of everyone in the choir? \n7. Can you think of a different problem where we might need to find the average of a group of numbers? \n8. What are some common mistakes students might make when solving this type of problem? \n9. How would you explain this problem to someone who is not familiar with algebra?"
