    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Recall that ``four-thirds of\" is the same as ``four-thirds times\".  This means that four-thirds of $\\frac{9}{2}$ is the same as $\\frac{4}{3}\\cdot \\frac{9}{2}=\\frac{4\\cdot 9}{3\\cdot 2}$.  By the commutative property of multiplication we know that $\\frac{4\\cdot 9}{3\\cdot 2}=\\frac{9\\cdot 4}{3\\cdot 2}=\\frac{9}{3}\\cdot \\frac{4}{2}=3\\cdot 2=\\boxed{6}.$",
