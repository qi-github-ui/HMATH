    "solution": "Drawing an altitude of an equilateral triangle splits it into two 30-60-90 right triangles: [asy]\nunitsize(0.6inch);\npair A, B, C, F;\nA = (0,1);\nB = rotate(120)*A;\nC = rotate(120)*B;\nF = foot(A,B,C);\ndraw(A--B--C--A,linewidth(1));\ndraw(A--F);\n[/asy]\n\nThe altitude is the longer leg of each 30-60-90 triangle, and the hypotenuse of each 30-60-90 triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle, so the altitude's length is $\\sqrt{3}/2$ times the side length of the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the altitude of the equilateral triangle in the problem is $8(\\sqrt{3}/2) = 4\\sqrt{3}$, so the area of the equilateral triangle is $(8)(4\\sqrt{3})/2 = 16\\sqrt{3}$. The perimeter of the triangle is $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$. Thus, the ratio of area to perimeter is $\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{24}=\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}.$",
