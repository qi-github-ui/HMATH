    "problem": "The Little Twelve Basketball Conference has two divisions, with six teams in each division. Each team plays each of the other teams in its own division twice and every team in the other division once. How many conference games are scheduled?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Each team plays 10 games in its own division and 6 games against teams in the other division. So each of the 12 teams plays 16 conference games. Because each game involves two teams, there are $\\frac{12\\times 16}{2}=\\boxed{96}$ games scheduled.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How many teams are there in total in The Little Twelve Basketball Conference?\n2. How many games does each team play in its own division?\n3. How many games does each team play against teams in the other division?\n4. Why do we need to multiply the number of teams by the number of games each team plays?\n5. Why do we divide the total by 2?\n6. Can you think of any other scenarios where you can apply similar thinking to count the number of games scheduled?"
