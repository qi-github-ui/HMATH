    "solution": "We begin by considering a point $P$ which is where the circle first touches a line $L.$\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(20,0),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw(circle((5,3),3),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw(circle((15,3),3),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((5,0)--(5,3),black+linewidth(1)+dashed);\ndraw((5,3)--(15,3),black+linewidth(1)+dashed);\ndraw((15,3)--(15,0),black+linewidth(1)+dashed);\nlabel(\"$L$\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"$P$\",(5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(5,3),W);\nlabel(\"$P'$\",(15,0),S);\nlabel(\"$C'$\",(15,3),E);\n[/asy]\n\nIf a circle makes one complete revolution, the point $P$ moves to $P'$ and the distance $PP'$ is the circumference of the circle, or $2 \\pi\\text{ m}.$\n\nIf we now complete the rectangle, we can see that the distance the center travels is $CC'$ which is exactly equal to $PP'$ or $\\boxed{2 \\pi}$ meters.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. Can you describe what happens to the circle as it rolls in a straight line through one complete revolution?\n2. What point on the circle do we consider to determine the distance traveled by the center?\n3. If the circle makes one complete revolution, what is the distance traveled by the point of contact with the line?\n4. How can we relate the distance traveled by the point of contact with the line to the distance traveled by the center of the wheel?\n5. What shape can we create by completing a rectangle with the line and the points of contact on the circle?\n6. How does the distance traveled by the center of the wheel relate to the circumference of the circle?\n7. Can you calculate the distance traveled by the center of the wheel after one complete revolution?\n8. If the radius of the wheel was different, would the distance traveled by the center be the same? How would it change?\n9. Can you think of any real-world scenarios where understanding the distance traveled by the center of a rolling wheel could be useful?\n10. Are there any other mathematical concepts or principles that can be related to the distance traveled by the center of the wheel?"
