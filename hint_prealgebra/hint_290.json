    "solution": "Seeing that triangle $ACD$ is a 5-12-13 right triangle, $AD=12$. Then using Pythagorean Theorem, we can calculate $BD$ to be $BD=\\sqrt{15^2-12^2}=\\sqrt{3^2(5^2-4^2)}=3\\sqrt{25-16}=3\\sqrt{9}=3 \\cdot 3 = 9$. Thus, the area of triangle $ABD$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 12 \\cdot 9=6 \\cdot 9=54 \\text{sq units}$ and the area of triangle $ACD$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 12 \\cdot 5=6 \\cdot 5=30 \\text{sq units}$. The area of triangle $ABC$ is the difference between the two areas: $54 \\text{sq units} - 30 \\text{sq units} = \\boxed{24} \\text{sq units}$.",
