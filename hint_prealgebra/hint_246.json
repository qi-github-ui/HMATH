    "problem": "The longest side of a right triangle is 5 meters and the shortest side is 3 meters. What is the area of the triangle in square meters?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We know that the hypotenuse (the longest side) of the right triangle is $5$ meters and the shortest side is $3$ meters and that $3,4,5$ is a Pythagorean triple. Therefore, the other leg of the triangle must have a length of $4$ meters. Since the two legs are also the base and the height of the triangle, we have that the area of the triangle is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}(3)(4) = \\boxed{6}$ square meters.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the Pythagorean Formula to find the length of the other side. If $y$ is the length of the other leg, then we have that $3^2 + y^2 = 5^2$, so $y^2=5^2-3^2=16$. Taking the square root of both sides, we have that $y=4$. Since we have the lengths of both legs, we can now find that the area of the triangle is $6$ square meters.",
    "socratic_questions": "1. How do we determine the length of the missing side of a right triangle when we know the lengths of the other two sides?\n2. Can you describe what a Pythagorean triple is and how it relates to right triangles?\n3. What formula can we use to find the length of the missing side in a right triangle if we know the lengths of the other two sides?\n4. How can we determine the area of a right triangle? What do we need to know in order to calculate the area?\n5. How did we determine that the lengths of the two legs of the triangle are 3 meters and 4 meters?\n6. Is there another method we could have used to find the length of the missing side in this triangle? How would we go about using that method?\n7. In general, what are some strategies we can use to find missing sides or angles in right triangles?\n8. Can you think of any real-life situations where knowledge of right triangles and their properties would be useful?"
